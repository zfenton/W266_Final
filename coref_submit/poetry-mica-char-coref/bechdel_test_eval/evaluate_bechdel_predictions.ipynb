    "- After running the Coreference Resolution Model to identify instances of characters within each script (coreference_resolution_predict.py)(Sabyasachee Baruah and Shrikanth Narayanan. 2023), we use a set of engineered rules to capture the results of the Bechdel Test.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We first identify conversations with two women if characters identified with the coreference model have woman-identifying pronouns.\n",
    "    - We use a set of rules to capture the beginning and end of conversations within scenes. See the function `extract_women_conversations_with_target` for more details.\n",
    "    - It's important to note that we conducted numerous experiments to test conversation detection. After examining negative predictions, we found that a lot of missed cases dealt with the challenges of dialogue within the right conversation, and that the rule implementation did not succeed in capturing conversation in many cases and thus misrepresented conversations for the appropriate test. \n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Therefore, we tested many other conversation detection approaches such as unsupervised embedding clustering, directed graphs, generative ai classification, question and answer classification, and pre-training conversation span detection models via the Cornell dataset.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - We unfortunately did not have the time or resources to thoroughly explore these options, and it would be a point of emphasis for the project moving forward."
