Our angle looks straight\\nN up.\\nN Now an angle looking steeply down: the snow falls not quite dead\\nN away to collect on a\\nN foreground chimneypot and on the little shtetl street that lies\\nN maplike below us.\\nN It is night, and quiet, and the street is deserted except for\\nN one man who walks away from\\nN us, his valenki squeaking in the fresh snow. He carries bundled\\nN branches on one shoulder\\nN and has a hatchet tucked into his belt.\\nN We cut down to street level. The man walks toward us, bearded,\\nN and bundled against the\\nN cold. Smiling, he mutters in Yiddish-the dialogue subtitled.\\nC MAN\\nD What a marvel... what a marvel...\\nS HOUSE INTERIOR\\nN As its door opens and the man enters.\\nC MAN\\nC Dora!\\nC VOICE\\nD Yes...\\nN The man crosses to the stove with his bundle of wood. The voice\\nO continues:\\nO 2\\nD . Can you help me with the ice?\\nN The man dumps the wood into a box by the stove as his wife enters\\nN with an ice pick.\\nD . I expected you hours ago.\\nC MAN\\nD You can't imagine what just happened. I was coming back\\nN on the Lublin road when the wheel came off the cart\\nD thank heavens it was the way back and I'd already sold the\\nD geese!\\nC WIFE\\nD How much?\\nC MAN\\nD Fifteen groshen, but that's not the story. I was struggling to\\nN set the cart upright when a droshky approaches from the\\nN direction of Lvov. How lucky, you think, that someone is\\nD out this late.\\nC WIFE\\nD Yes, very remarkable.\\nC MAN\\nD But that's the least of it! He stops to help me; we talk of\\nD this, we talk of that-it turns out this is someone you know!\\nD Traitle Groshkover!\\nN His wife stares at him as he beams.\\nN He takes the stare as a sign that she can't place the name.\\nN . You know, REB GROSHKOVER! Pesel Bunim's uncle!\\nN The chacham from Lodz, who studied under the Zohar reb\\nN in Krakow!\\nN Still she stares. Then, quietly:\\nC WIFE\\nD God has cursed us.\\nC MAN\\nD What?\\nC WIFE\\nD Traitle Groshkover has been dead for three years.\\nN Laughter erupts from the man but, as his wife continues to stare\\nN at him, he strangles on it.\\nN Quiet.\\nS Wind whistles under the eaves.\\nN The man says quietly:\\nC MAN\\nD Why do you say such a thing! I saw the man! I talked to him!\\nC WIFE\\nD You talked to a dybbuk. Traitle Groshkover died of typhus\\nN in Pesel Bunim's house. Pesel told me-she sat shiva for\\nD him.\\nN They stare at each through a silence broken only by the sound\\nN of the quickening wind.\\nN A rap at the door.\\nN Neither immediately responds.\\nN Finally, to her husband:\\nC Who is it?\\nD MAN\\nN For some soup, to warm himself.\\nN The wind moans. He helped me, Dora!\\nN THE DOOR\\nN We are looking in from the outside as it unlatches and creaks\\nN in, opened by the husband\\nN in the foreground, who has arranged his face into a strained\\nN look of greeting. In the\\nN background the wife stares, hollow-eyed.\\nC MAN\\nN REB GROSHKOVER! You are welcome here!\\nN Reverse on REB GROSHKOVER: a short, merry-looking fellow with\\nN a bifurcated beard and a\\nN silk hat and spectacles. He gives a little squeal of delight.\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD You are too kind, Velvel! Too kind!\\nN He steps into the house and sees the wife staring at him.\\nD And you must be Dora! So much I have heard of you!\\nD Yes, your cheeks are pink and your legs are stout! What a\\nD wife you have!\\nN The husband chuckles nervously.\\nC MAN\\nD Yes! A ray of sun, a ray of sun! Sit!\\nC WIFE\\nD My husband said he offered you soup.\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD Yes, but I couldn't possibly eat this late, or I'd have\\nD nightmares. No, no: no soup for me!\\nC WIFE\\nD I knew it.\\nN REB GROSHKOVER laughs.\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD I see! You think I'm fat enough already!\\nN He settles, chuckling, into his chair, but Dora remains sober:\\nC WIFE\\nD No. A dybbuk doesn't eat.\\nO 5\\nN REB GROSHKOVER stares at her, shocked.\\nN The wife returns the stare.\\nN The husband looks from wife to REB GROSHKOVER, apprehensive.\\nN A heavy silence.\\nN REB GROSHKOVER bursts into pealing laughter.\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD What a wife you have!\\nN He wipes away tears of merriment; the husband relaxes, even begins\\nN to smile.\\nC MAN\\nD I assure you, REB GROSHKOVER, it's nothing personal; she\\nD heard a story you had died, three years ago, at Pesel\\nD Bunim's house. This is why she think you are a dybbuk; I,\\nD of course, do not believe in such things. I am a rational\\nD man.\\nN REB GROSHKOVER is still chuckling.\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD Oh my. Oh my yes. What nonsense. And even if there\\nD were spirits, certainly...\\nN He thumps his chest.\\nD I am not one of them!\\nC WIFE\\nD Pesel always worried. Your corpse was left unattended for\\nD many minutes when Pesel's father broke shiva and left the\\nD room-it must have been then that the Evil One-\\nN She breaks off to spit at the mention of the Evil One.\\nD -took you!\\nN REB GROSHKOVER is terribly amused:\\nO 6\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD \\\"My corpse!\\\" Honestly! What a wife you have!\\nC WIFE\\nD Oh yes? Look, husband...\\nN She steps forward to the Reb, who looks enquiringly up at her.\\nN They were preparing the body. Pesel's father shaved\\nD one check...\\nN As his eyes roll down to look at her hand, she draws it across\\nN his smooth right cheek.\\nN Then he left the room. He came back, and shaved the\\nD other...\\nN She reaches across to the other cheek, REB GROSHKOVER's eyes\\nN following her hand-\\nD You were already gone!\\nN -and drags her hand across. A bristly sound.\\nN REB GROSHKOVER laughs.\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD I shaved hastily this morning and missed a bit-by you this\\nD makes me a dybbuk?\\nD He appeals to the husband:\\nD It's true, I was sick with typhus when I stayed with\\nD Peselle, but I recovered, as you can plainly see, and now\\nD I-hugh!\\nN The wife steps back.\\nN REB GROSHKOVER looks slowly down at his own chest in which the\\nN wife has just planted an\\nN ice pick.\\nN REB GROSHKOVER stares at the ice pick.\\nN The wife stares.\\nO 7\\nN The husband stares.\\nN Suddenly, REB GROSHKOVER bursts out laughing:\\nN What a wife you have!\\nN The husband can manage only a shocked whisper:\\nC MAN\\nD Woman, what have you done?\\nN REB GROSHKOVER again looks down at his chest, which again moves\\nN him to laughter. He\\nN shakes his head.\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD Why would she do such a thing?\\nN He looks up.\\nN I ask you, Velvel, as a rational man: which of us is\\nD possessed?\\nC WIFE\\nD What do you say now about spirits? He is unharmed!\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD On the contrary! I don't feel at all well.\\nD And indeed, blood has begun to soak through his vest.\\nN He chuckles with less energy.\\nN One does a mitzvah and this is the thanks one gets?\\nC MAN\\nD Dora! Woe, woe! How can such a thing be!\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD Perhaps I will have some soup. I am feeling weak...\\nN He rises to his feet but totters.\\nD Or perhaps I should go...\\nO 8\\nN He smiles weakly at Dora..\\nN One knows when one isn't wanted.\\nN He walks unsteadily to the door, opens it with some effort, and\\nN staggers out into the\\nN moaning wind and snow to be swallowed by the night.\\nN The wife and husband stare at the door banging in the wind.\\nN FINALLY:\\nC MAN\\nD Dear wife. We are ruined. Tomorrow they will discover\\nN the body. All is lost.\\nC WIFE\\nD Nonsense, Velvel...\\nN She walks to the door...\\nN Blessed is the Lord. Good riddance to evil and shuts it against\\nN the wind.\\nN BLACK\\nN A drumbeat thumps in the black.\\nN Music blares: the Jefferson Airplane. Grace Slick's voice enters:\\nN When the truth is found to be lies\\nN And all the hope inside you dies\\nN Don't you want somebody to love. . .\\nN An image fades in slowly, but even up full it is dim: some kind\\nN of round, dull white shape\\nN with a small black pinhole center. This white half-globe is a\\nN plug set in a flesh-toned\\nN field. The flesh tone glows translucently, backlit. We are drifting\\nN toward the white plug\\nN and, as we do so, the music grows louder still.\\nN AN EARPIECE\\nO 9\\nN A pull back-a reverse on the preceding push in-from the cheap\\nN white plastic earpiece\\nN of a transistor radio. The Jefferson Airplane continues over\\nN the cut but becomes\\nN extremely compressed. The pull back reveals that the earpiece\\nN is lodged in someone's\\nN ear and trails a white cord.\\nN We drift down the cord to find the radio at its other end. As\\nD we do so we hear, live in the\\nN room, many voices speaking a foreign language in unison. A classroom,\\nN apparently.\\nN The radio is on a desktop but hidden from in front by the book\\nN held open before it. The\\nN book is written in non-Roman characters.\\nN We are in Hebrew school.\\nN The boy who is listening to the transistor radio-DANNY Gopnik-sits\\nN at a hinge-topped\\nN desk in a cinderblock classroom whose rows of desks are occupied\\nN by other boys and\\nN girls of about twelve years of age. It is dusk and the room is\\nN flourescent-lit.\\nN At the front of the room a gray-haired man in a worn suit and\\nN tie addresses the class.\\nN DANNY straightens one leg so that he may dig into a pocket. With\\nN an eye on the TEACHER to\\nN make sure he isn't being watched, he eases something out:\\nN A twenty-dollar bill.\\nN TEACHER\\nN Mee yodayah? Reuven? Rifkah? Mah zeh \\\"anakim\\\"?\\nN Efsheh mashooach ba-avodah?\\nN A BLINDING LIGHT\\nN At the cut to the light the Jefferson Airplane music jumps up\\nN full. The light resolves into\\nN a multi-flared image of a blinking eye.\\nN Reverse: the inside of a human ear. Fleshy whorls finely veined,\\nN a cavity receding to\\nN dark.\\nN Objective on the DOCTOR's office: the DOCTOR is peering through\\nN a lightscope into the ear of\\nN an early-middle-aged man, LARRY Gopnik.\\nN The Jefferson Airplane music continues.\\nO 10\\nC DOCTOR\\nD Uh-huh.\\nC HEBREW SCHOOL\\nN Close on Hebrew characters being scribbled onto the blackboard\\nN as the TEACHER talks.\\nN The TEACHER, talking.\\nN A bored child, staring off.\\nN His point-of-view: a blacktopped parking lot with a few orange\\nS school busses, beyond it a\\nN marshy field, and distant suburban bungalows.\\nN Close on another child staring at something through drooping\\nN eyelids.\\nN His point-of-view: very close on the face of a classroom clock.\\nN We hear its electrical\\nN hum. Its red sweep-second hand crawls around the dial very, very\\nN slowly.\\nN DANNY Gopnik hisses:\\nC DANNY\\nD Fagle!.. .\\nN The TEACHER drones on, writing on the blackboard. DANNY's eyes\\nN flit from the TEACHER to\\nN the student sitting kitty-corner in front of him-a husky youth\\nN with shaggy hair. He\\nN hasn't heard the prompt.\\nD . Fagle!\\nN The TEACHER turns from the blackboard and DANNY leans back, eyes\\nN front, folding the\\nN twenty up small behind his book.\\nC TEACHER\\nN Ahnee rotzeh lalechet habait hakisai. Mee yodayah?\\nN Misaviv tamid anachnoo tamid...\\nN The clock-watching child, eyelids sinking, is beginning to drool\\nN out of one side of his\\nD mouth.\\nS DOCTOR'S OFFICE\\nO 11\\nN The light again flaring the lens.\\nN Reverse: looking into a pupil.\\nN Objective: the DOCTOR looking through his scope into LARRY's\\nN eye.\\nC DOCTOR\\nD Mm-hmm.\\nC HEBREW SCHOOL\\nN A bored child is excavating a bugger from his nose.\\nN The TEACHER turns back to the chalkboard to circle something.\\nC DANNY\\nD Fagle!\\nC TEACHER\\nC Hamrah oomoh-\\nN He interrupts himself briefly to make a couple of phlegm-hawking\\nN sounds. He resumes:\\nN . Hamrah oomoh meshiach oomshel zal?\\nS DOCTOR'S OFFICE\\nN The DOCTOR palpates LARRY's midriff, digging his fingers into\\nN the hairy, baggy flesh.\\nC DOCTOR's Voice\\nD Uh-huh. We'll do some routine X-rays.\\nC HEBREW SCHOOL\\nN A young girl holds a hank of her bangs in front of her face,\\nN separating out individual hairs\\nN to examine them for split ends.\\nC TEACHER\\nN Ahnoo ahnoo mah? Mah? Talmidim? D'vorah?\\nO 12\\nC D'VORAH\\nD Ahnee to yodayah.\\nN The TEACHER begins to pace the desk aisles, looking back and\\nN forth among the students.\\nC TEACHER\\nD Mee yodayah?\\nD The bugger-seeker, having succesfully withdrawn a bugger, carefully\\nN drapes it over the\\nN sharp end of his pencil, to what end we cannot know.\\nN DANNY, apprehensively eyeing the TEACHER, slides the twenty into\\nN the transistor radio's\\nN cover-sleeve.\\nM X-RAY CONE\\nN A huge white rubberized cone, pointed directly at us.\\nN We hear a rush of static and the DOCTOR's voice filtered through\\nN a talk-back:\\nN DOCTOR's Voice\\nD Hold still.\\nN Wider: LARRY is in his shorts lying on his back on an examining\\nN table covered by a sheet\\nN of tissue paper. The X-ray cone is pointed at the middle of his\\nN body.\\nN There is a brief sci-fi-like machine hum. It clicks off.\\nN HEBREW SCHOOL\\nN The clock-watching student's head is making descending bobs toward\\nN his chest.\\nC TEACHER\\nD Nefsheh shelach hamilamid-eh?!\\nN The TEACHER's circuit of the classroom has taken him around behind\\nN DANNY. DANNY's\\nN book lies face-down on the desk, covering the radio, but the\\nN white cord snakes out from\\nN under it up to his ear.\\nN The TEACHER yanks at the cord.\\nO 13\\nN The cord pops out of its jack and the Jefferson Airplane blares\\nN tinnily from beneath the\\nS book of torah stories.\\nN The TEACHER lifts the book to expose the jangling radio.\\nN Outraged, the TEACHER projects above the music:\\nN . Mah zeh? ! Mah zeh? !\\nN Some of the students are singing along; a couple beat rhythm\\nN on their desks.\\nN . Shechet, talmidim! Anachnoo lo cam zeh b'bait sefer!\\nN Shechet bivakasha!\\nN Three other students join in a chorus:\\nD STUDENTS\\nN Shechet! Shechet bivakasha!\\nN The nodding student's head droops ever lower.\\nN Other students join in the chant:\\nN SHECHET! SHECHET! SHECHET BIVAKASHA!\\nN The nodding student's chin finally reaches, and settles on, his\\nN chest, and he gives a long\\nN snorfling inhale of sleep.\\nS DOCTOR'S OFFICE\\nN LARRY, now fully clothed, is seated across from the DOCTOR.\\nN The DOCTOR is looking at his file. He absently taps a cigarette\\nN out of a pack and lights up.\\nN He nods as he smokes, looking at the file.\\nC DOCTOR\\nD Well, I-sorry.\\nN He holds the pack toward LARRY.\\nO 14\\nC LARRY\\nD No thanks.\\nC DOCTOR\\nD Well, you're in good health. How're Judith and the kids?\\nC LARRY\\nD Good. Everyone's good. You know.\\nN The DOCTOR takes a long suck.\\nC DOCTOR\\nD Good. Daniel must be-what? About to be bar mitzvah?\\nC LARRY\\nD Two weeks.\\nC DOCTOR\\nD Well, mazel tov. They grow up fast, don't they?\\nS TINTED PHOTO PORTRAIT\\nN The portrait, old, in an ornate gilt frame, is of a middle-aged\\nN rabbi with a small neat\\nN mustache and round spectacles. He wears a tallis hood-style and\\nN a phylactery box is\\nN strapped to his forehead. A plaque set into the frame identifies\\nN the man as Rabbi Minda.\\nN Wider shows that the portrait hangs in the Hebrew school principal's\\nN office, a white\\nN cinderblock room. It is quiet. The only sound is a deep electrical\\nN hum.\\nN Just visible behind the principal's desk, upon which is a low\\nN stack of books and a name\\nN plate identifying the occupant as MAR TURCHIK, is the top of\\nN a man's head-an old\\nN man, with a few whispy white hairs where his yarmulka is not.\\nN DANNY, seated opposite, pushes up from his slouch to better see\\nN across the desk.\\nN We boom up to show more of the principal. He is short. He wears\\nN a white shirt and\\nN hoist-up pants that come to just below his armpits. He has thick\\nN eyeglasses. He fiddles\\nN with the transistor radio, muttering:\\nC PRINCIPAL\\nD Hmm... eh... nu?\\nO 15\\nN He experiments with different dials on the radio.\\nN DANNY nervously watches.\\nC DANNY\\nD You put the-\\nN The old man holds up one hand.\\nC PRINCIPAL\\nE In ivrit. (In Hebrew)\\nC DANNY\\nD Um...\\nN The old man looks down at the little earpiece pinched between\\nN two fingers. He examines\\nN it as a superstitious native might a Coca-Cola bottle.\\nN The source of the electrical hum: a wall clock whose red sweep-second\\nN hand crawls\\nN around the dial very, very slowly.\\nN The Reb continues to squint at the earpiece.\\nN DANNY sighs. He encourages:\\nC DANNY\\nD Yeah, you-\\nN The principal's tone is harder:\\nC PRINCIPAL\\nD In ivrit!\\nN This time his cold look holds until he is sure that the admonishment\\nN has registered.\\nN He looks back down at the earpiece.\\nN We hear the door open. The principal ignores it.\\nN An old woman walks slowly in with a teacup chattering on a saucer.\\nN She has thick\\nN eyeglasses. She wears thick flesh-colored support hose. She takes\\nN slow, short steps\\nN toward the desk. The principal is studying the radio.\\nO 16\\nC PRINCIPAL\\nD Mneh...\\nN The old woman continues to take slow short steps toward him.\\nN The tableau looks like a\\nN performance-art piece.\\nN She reaches the desk and sets the teacup down. She summons a\\nN couple of phlegm-\\nN hawking rasps and turns to go.\\nN She takes slow short steps toward the door.\\nN The principal raises the earpiece experimentally toward his ear.\\nN Close on his hairy, wrinkled ear as his trembling fingers bring\\nN in the earpiece. The\\nN i f ngers push and wobble and tamp the earpiece into place, hesitate,\\nN and then do some\\nN more pushing and wobbling and tamping.\\nN The principal keeps DANNY fixed with a stare as his hand hesitantly\\nN drops from his ear,\\nN ready to reach back up should the earpiece loosen.\\nN .mneh...\\nN Satisfied that neither the student nor the earpiece are about\\nN to make any sudden moves, he\\nN looks down at the radio. He turns a dial.\\nN Faintly and tinnily from the earpiece we hear the compressed\\nN jangle of rock music. The\\nN rabbi stares blankly, listening.\\nN DANNY slumps, looking warily at the rabbi.\\nN The rabbi continues to stare down at the radio. The compressed\\nN rock music jangles on.\\nN The rabbi is expressionless, mouth slightly open, listening.\\nN Tableau: anxious student, earplugged spiritual leader.\\nN Muffled, from the outer office, the hawking of phlegm.\\nC CLASSROOM\\nN We are behind a man who writes equations on a chalkboard, shoulder\\nN at work and hand\\nN quickly waggling.

And that's\\nN Schrodinger's paradox, right? Is the cat dead or is the cat\\nN not dead? Okay?\\nS BLEGEN HALL\\nN LARRY is entering the physics department office. The department's\\nN secretary wheels her\\nN castored chair away from her typing.\\nC SECRETARY\\nD Messages, Professor Gopnik.\\nN He takes the three phone messages.\\nC LARRY\\nD Thank you, Natalie. Oh-CLIVE. Come in.\\nD A Korean graduate student who was been waiting on a straightbacked\\nN chair rises.\\nC LARRY'S OFFICE\\nN He is flipping through the messages.

In fact: F, the failing\\nD grade.\\nC LARRY\\nD Uh, yes. You failed the mid-term. That's accurate.\\nC CLIVE\\nD Yes, but this is not just. I was unaware to be examined on\\nD the mathematics.\\nC LARRY\\nD Well-you can't do physics without mathematics, really,\\nD can you.\\nC CLIVE\\nD If I receive failing grade I lose my scholarship, and feel\\nD shame. I understand the physics. I understand the dead cat.\\nC LARRY\\nE (SURPRISED)\\nD You understand the dead cat?\\nO 19\\nC CLIVE nods gravely.\\nD But... you... you can't really understand the physics\\nN without understanding the math. The math tells how it\\nD really works. That's the real thing; the stories I give you in\\nN class are just illustrative; they're like, fables, say, to help\\nN give you a picture. An imperfect model. I mean-even I\\nN don't understand the dead cat. The math is how it really\\nN works.\\nN CLIVE shakes his head, dubious.\\nC CLIVE\\nD Very difficult... very difficult...\\nC LARRY\\nD Well, I... I'm sorry, but I... what do you propose?\\nC CLIVE\\nD Passing grade.\\nC LARRY\\nD No no, I-\\nC CLIVE\\nD Or perhaps I can take the mid-term again. Now I know it\\nD covers mathematics.\\nC LARRY\\nD Well, the other students wouldn't like that, would they. If\\nD one student gets to retake the test til he gets a grade he\\nD likes.\\nN CLIVE impassively considers this.\\nC CLIVE\\nD Secret test.\\nN LARRY wraps a hand wearily over his eyes.\\nC LARRY\\nD .

The secretary outside, her back\\nN to us, types on.\\nN LARRY. looks stupidly around his own office, shakes his head.\\nN He picks up the phone message from Sy Ableman-\\\"Let's talk\\\"-and\\nN dials. As he dials\\nN his other hand wanders over the papers on the desktop.\\nN There is a plain white envelope on the desk. LARRY picks it up\\nN as the phone rings through.\\nN A ring is clipped short and a warm basso-baritone rumbles through\\nN the line:\\nN Phone Voice\\nD Sy Ableman.\\nC LARRY\\nD Hello, Sy, LARRY Gopnik.\\nC SY\\nE (MOURNFUL)\\nD LARRY. How are you, my friend.\\nN LARRY picks idly at the envelope.\\nC LARRY\\nD Good, how've you been, Sy?\\nO 21\\nN Inside the envelope: a thick sheaf of one-hundred-dollar bills.\\nC SY\\nD Oh fine.

Hebrew characters\\nD on the side identify it-to some, anyway.\\nS INSIDE\\nN We are locked down on DANNY as the bus rattles like an old crate,\\nN squeaking, grinding\\nN gears, belching exhaust. DANNY and the children around him vibrate\\nN and pitch about but,\\nN from their lack of reaction, seem used to it.\\nN They raise their voices to be heard over the engine noise and\\nN the various stress noises in\\nN the chassis and a transistor radio somewhere that plays Jefferson\\nN Airplane.\\nC DANNY\\nD I had twenty bucks in it too.

The purr\\nN of a lawn mower. He\\nN looks.\\nN His point-of-view: Gar Brandt, the next-door neighbor, is mowing\\nN his lawn. He has a\\nN buzz cut and is wearing a white T-shirt.\\nN Another noise competes with the lawn mower: rattling, squeaking,\\nN gear-grinding. The\\nN orange school bus with Hebrew lettering pulls up across the street.\\nN Its door opens with a\\nN pneumatic hiss to discharge a passenger.\\nO 25\\nS DINNER TABLE\\nN LARRY sits in.

LARRY sits at the kitchen table, a briefcase\\nN open on the chair next to\\nN him. Blue books-examination booklets-are spread on the table\\nN in front of him. He\\nN reads, occasionally making marginal scribbles, grading.\\nN From off, faint and dulled by intervening walls, rock music:\\nN somewhere in the house\\nN DANNY is listening to the Jefferson Airplane.\\nN The clink of teaspoon against china as LARRY stirs his tea.

Very uncertain.\\nT CLOSE ON A TONE ARM\\nN A hand lays it onto a slowly spinning vinyl record.\\nN Through scratches and pops, a solo tenor starts a mournful Hebrew\\nN chant.\\nN Close on the sleeve:\\nN Rabbi Youssele Rosenblatt Chants Your Haftorah Portion\\nS VOLUME 12\\nN Rabbi Youssele wears a caftan and a felt hat and has sad eyes.\\nN They peer out from the\\nN dark beard that covers most of the rest of his face like owl's\\nN eyes peering out of the\\nN woods.\\nN Wider, on DANNY, in his bedroom, evening. He lifts the tone arm\\nN on the portable\\nS turntable.\\nN He chants the passage.\\nN He drops the tone arm at the same place; Rabbi Youssele chants\\nN the passage again.\\nN DANNY listens, eyes narrowed.

On top of the music is a hissing-sucking sound. There\\nN is also the sound of a\\nN pencil busily scratching paper.\\nN We cut to its source: Uncle Arthur sits scribbling into a spiral\\nN notebook, his free hand\\nN holding the end of a length of surgical tubing against the back\\nN of his neck. The tube leads\\nN to a water-pik-like appliance on an end table next to him-the\\nD source of the sucking\\nD sound.\\nN After a long beat of listening to the music, LARRY speaks into\\nN space:\\nO 37\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur?\\nD Uncle Arthur does not look up from his scribbling.\\nC Uncle Arthur\\nD Yes.\\nN LARRY continues to stare at the ceiling.\\nC LARRY\\nD What're you doing?\\nD Still without looking up:\\nC Uncle Arthur\\nD Working on the Mentaculus.\\nD Long beat.

A fleshy face\\nN with droopy hangdog\\nN features, a five-o'clock shadow, and sad Harold Bloom eyes.\\nN LARRY opens the door.\\nO 38\\nC LARRY\\nD Sy.\\nN Sy, entering, thrusts out a hand. His voice vibrates with a warm,\\nN sad empathy:\\nC SY\\nD Good to see you, LARRY.\\nN He is a heavy-set man wearing a short-sleeved shirt that his\\nN belly tents out in front of\\nN him. In his left hand he holds a bottle of wine.\\nC LARRY\\nE (TIGHTLY)\\nD I'll get Judith.\\nC SY\\nD No, actually LARRY, I'm here to see you, if I might.\\nN He shakes his head.\\nD . Such a thing. Such a thing.\\nC LARRY\\nD Shall we go in the...\\nN He is leading him into the kitchen but Sy, oblivious to surroundings,\\nN plows on with the\\nN conversation, arresting both men in the narrow space between\\nS kitchen sink and stove, and\\nN invading LARRY's space.\\nC SY\\nD You know, LARRY-how we handle ourselves, in this\\nD situation-it's so impawtant.\\nC LARRY\\nD Uh-huh.\\nC SY\\nD Absolutely. Judith told me that she broke the news to you.\\nD She said you were very adult.\\nC LARRY\\nD Did she.\\nO 39\\nC SY\\nD Absolutely. The respect she has for you.\\nC LARRY\\nD Yes?\\nC SY\\nD Absolutely. But the children, LARRY. The children.\\nN He shakes his head.\\nD . The most impawtant.\\nC LARRY\\nD Well, I guess...\\nC SY\\nD Of coss. And Judith says they're handling it so well. A\\nD tribute to you. Do you drink wine? Because this is an\\nD incredible bottle. This is not Mogen David. This is a wine,\\nD LARRY. A bawdeaux.\\nC LARRY\\nD You know, Sy-\\nC SY\\nD Open it-let it breathe. Ten minutes.

These are signs and tokens, LARRY.\\nC LARRY\\nD I'm just-I'm not ungrateful, I'm, I just don't know a lot\\nD about wine and, given our respective, you know-\\nN He is startled when Sy abruptly hugs him.\\nC SY\\nO 40\\nD S' okay.\\nN He finishes the hug off with a couple of thumps on the back.\\nN S'okay. Wuhgonnabe fine.\\nN SKEWED ANGLE ON PARKING LOT\\nN We are dutch on a slit of a view through a cracked-open frosted\\nN window: the Hebrew\\nS school parking lot.\\nN The last couple of busses filled with students are rolling out\\nN of the lot. It is late\\nS afternoon.\\nN A reverse shows DANNY in a stall, standing on a closed toilet,\\nN angling his head to peer out\\nN the bathroom window opened at the top.\\nN The bathroom outside the stall: Ronnie Nudell leans against a\\nN sink waiting, sucking a\\nN long draw from a joint.\\nN DANNY emerges from the stall. Ronnie Nudell offers the joint.\\nC Ronnie Nudell\\nD Want some of this fucker?\\nS HALLWAY\\nN The bathroom door cracks open in the foreground. DANNY peeks\\nN out.\\nN His point-of-view: the empty hallway ending in a T with another\\nS hallway. A janitor\\nN crosses, pushing a broom down the far hallway. He disappears.\\nN His echoing footsteps\\nN recede.\\nN DANNY and Ronny emerge from the bathroom.\\nN RABBI MINDA\\nN The photo-portrait on the wall of Mar Turchik's office lit by\\nS late-day sun.\\nN We hear a scraping sound.\\nO 41\\nN Wider: Ronnie Nudell looks over DANNY's shoulder as DANNY, hunched\\nS at Mar Turchik's\\nN desk, fishes the end of a bent hanger into the keyhole on the\\nN top left drawer. After a beat,\\nN the hanger turns.\\nN They open the drawer. In it: squirt guns, marbles set to rolling\\nN by the opening of the\\nN drawer, a comic book, a Playboy magazine, a slingshot, a small\\nN bundle of firecrackers.\\nN Hands rifle the gewgaws: no radio.\\nC Ronnie Nudell\\nD Fuck.\\nS SANCTUARY\\nN We are behind the two boys who sit side by side on the last pew,\\nN staring at the front of\\nN the empty sanctuary. Its stained glass windows further weaken\\nS the late-afternoon light.\\nN In deference to the location, the boys wear yarmulkas.\\nN A long hold on their still backs.\\nN At length, some movement in DANNY's back, his head dips, and\\nN we hear him sucking on\\nN the joint. He holds it, exhales, and passes it wordlessly to\\nN Ronnie Nudell.\\nS SUBURBAN STREET\\nN We are pulling DANNY as he walks along the street, eyes red-rimmed,\\nN still wearing his\\nN yarmulka. It is dusk.\\nN After a few beats of walking, the front door of a house just\\nN behind DANNY opens. A\\nN husky, shaggy-haired youth emerges on the run.\\nN The sound has alerted DANNY. Seeing Mike Fagle, he too begins\\nN to run. He reaches up\\nN and grabs his yarmulka and clutches it in one of his pumping\\nN fists.\\nN Pursued and pursuer both run wordlessly, panting, feet pounding.\\nN Mike Fagle is closing. But DANNY is already cutting across the\\nS Brandt's front yard,\\nN approaching his own. He plunges into the house and slams the\\nN door.\\nN Mike Fagle draws up, panting, gazing hungrily at the house.\\nO 42\\nN Lights are on inside. The house is a warm yellow citadel in the\\nN dusk.\\nN After a beat we hear, faint and dulled, the Jefferson Airplane.\\nN Mike Fagle slinks away.\\nN PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS\\nN A shockingly blue sky with picture-perfect clouds hanging in\\nN it.\\nN After a beat the top of an aluminum extension ladder swings in\\nN from the bottom of the\\nN frame and comes toward us.\\nN We cut to a side angle as the ladder clunk against a roof.\\nN It starts vibrating to the rhythmic clung of someone climbing.\\nN Hands enter. LARRY's head enters.\\nN He climbs onto the roof.\\nN He takes a couple steps away from the edge and stands tentatively,\\nN making sure of his\\nN balance. He looks around.\\nN His point-of-view towards the front. An unfamiliarly high perspective\\nN on the street and\\nN the neighboring houses, almost maplike. Very peaceful. Wind rhythmically,\\nN gently\\nN waves the trees.\\nN LARRY gingerly walks up to the aerial at the peak of the roof.\\nN We are hearing a rhythmic\\nN popping noise.\\nN LARRY reaches the peak and straddles it. He looks down at the\\nN back yard.\\nN MITCH\\nD Ow.\\nN Foreshortened Gar Brandt and Mitch are playing catch in their\\nN back yard. With each toss\\nN the ball pops, alternately in father's mitt and son's.\\nN Precariously balanced, LARRY reaches out for the aerial. He tentatively\\nN touches it. He\\nN grasps it. He twists the aerial.\\nO 43\\nN Something strange: as it rotates the aerial creaks-a high whine\\nN as pure as the hum\\nN sounded from the rim of a wineglass.\\nN MITCH\\nD Ow.\\nN Faintly, under the wineglass sound, and clouded by static, a\\nN high, ringing tenor sings in\\nN an unfamiliar modality. Cantorial music.\\nN LARRY drops his hand. Inertia keeps the aerial rotating slowly\\nN til it dies, the sound drifting\\nN away into the sybillant shushing of trees.\\nN LARRY reaches out again to turn the aerial. The same crystal\\nN hum... cantorial singing...\\nN and now, layering in, the theme from F Troop.\\nN Music. Crystal hum. Wind.\\nN MITCH\\nN Ow.\\nN LARRY's look travels: his point-of-view pans slowly off the steep\\nN angle of father and son\\nN playing catch, travels across his own backyard, and brings in\\nN the white fence that\\nN encloses the patio of the neighbor on the other side.\\nN Gar (off)\\nD Good toss, Mitch.\\nN On the enclosed patio a woman reclines on a lawn chaise of nylon\\nN bands woven over an\\nN aluminum frame. She is on her back, eyes closed against the sun.\\nN She is naked.\\nC Mitch (off)\\nD Ow.\\nN LARRY reacts to the naked woman: startled at first, he moves\\nN to hide behind the peak of the\\nN roof. But as he realizes that the sun keeps the woman's eyes\\nN closed he relaxes, continu-\\nN ing to stare.\\nN She is attractive. Not young, not old: LARRY's age. Peaceful.\\nN After a still beat one of her hands gropes blindly to the side.\\nN It finds an ashtray on the\\nN table next to her and takes from it a pluming cigarette. The\\nN woman takes a puff and\\nN replaces it.\\nO 44\\nE Mitch (off)\\nD Ow.\\nS F Troop. Cantorial singing.\\nN Blue sky and white puffy clouds.\\nN The sound of a pencil scratching against paper.\\nN NOTEBOOK\\nN A pencil scratches equations into a lamplit spiral notebook.\\nN Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut. So does the spluttering suck-sound\\nN of Uncle Arthur's\\nS evacuator.\\nN Wider on Uncle Arthur, in his pyjamas, propped up on the narrow\\nN fold-out sofa, writing\\nN with one hand as he holds the evacuator hose to his neck with\\nN the other.\\nN Squeezed into the living room next to the fold-out sofa is a\\nN camp cot of plaid-patterned\\nN nylon stretched over an aluminum frame. On the camp cot is LARRY,\\nN lying half-in, half-\\nN out of a rumpled sleeping bag. He stares at the ceiling, a damp\\nN washcloth pressed against\\nN his forehead. His face is flaming red.\\nN Arthur speaks absently as he scribbles:\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Will you read this? Tell me what you think?\\nN LARRY continues to stare at the ceiling.\\nC LARRY\\nD Okay.\\nN Uncle Arthur glances up from the notebook, focuses on LARRY.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Boy. You should've worn a hat.\\nD LATER\\nO 45\\nN The lights are out. Very quiet. Uncle Arthur lightly snores.\\nN LARRY still stares at the ceiling. He shifts his weight. The\\nN aluminum frame of the cot\\nN squeaks. He shifts again. Another creak.\\nN LARRY fishes his watch from the jumble of clothes on the floor:\\nN 4:50.\\nS KITCHEN\\nN LARRY, in his underwear, spoons ground coffee into the percolator.\\nN Uncle Arthur snores\\nN softly on in the other room.\\nN From outside, a dull thunk.\\nN LARRY pulls back a curtain.\\nN Next door, Gar Brandt is going down the walk, wearing camouflage\\nN togs and camo billed\\nN cap, a rifle bag slung over his shoulder. He is carrying an ice\\nN chest, its contents clicking\\nN and sloshing.\\nN The boy Mitch, also wearing camo clothes and cap and also with\\nN a rifle bag, has just\\nN closed the front door. He now lets the screen door swing shut\\nN behind him and follows his\\nN father down the walk to the car in the driveway.\\nN The twitter of early morning birds. Gar's voice, though not projected,\\nN stands out in the\\nS pre-dawn quiet:\\nM GAR\\nN Let's see some hustle, Mitch.\\nT CLOSE ON THE NOTEBOOK\\nN Its top sheet, densely covered by equations, has a heading:\\nN The Mentaculus\\nS Compiled by Arthur Gopnik\\nN After a beat LARRY's hand enters to turn the page. The second\\nN page is also densely\\nN covered with equations.\\nO 46\\nC VOICE\\nC LARRY?\\nN This brings LARRY's look up from the Mentaculus. We are in LARRY's\\nN office. Standing in\\nN the office doorway is Arlen Finkle.\\nC LARRY\\nD Hi Arlen.\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD LARRY, I feel that, as head of the tenure committee I should\\nD tell you this, though it should be no cause for concern. You\\nD should not be at all worried.\\nN LARRY waits for more. Arlen seems to need a prompt.\\nC LARRY\\nD Okay.\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD I feel I should mention it even though we won't give this\\nD any weight at all in considering whether to grant you\\nD tenure, so, I repeat no cause for concern.\\nC LARRY\\nD Okay, Arlen. Give what any weight?\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD We have received some letters, uh... denigrating you, and,\\nD well, urging that we not grant you tenure.\\nC LARRY\\nD From who?\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD They're anonymous. And so of course we dismiss them\\nD completely.\\nC LARRY\\nD Well... well... what do they say?\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD They make allegations, not even allegations, assertions, but\\nC 47\\nD I'm not really... while we give them no credence, LARRY,\\nD I'm not supposed to deal in any specifics about the\\nD committee's deliberations.\\nC LARRY\\nD But... I think you're saying, these won't play any part in\\nD your deliberations.\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD None at all.\\nC LARRY\\nD Um, so what are they...\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD Moral turpitude. You could say.\\nC LARRY\\nD Uh-huh. Can I ask, are they, are they-idiomatic?\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD I, uh...\\nC LARRY\\nD The reason I ask, I have a Korean student, South Korean,\\nD disgruntled South Korean, and I meant to talk to you about\\nD this, actually, he-\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD No. No, the letters are competently-even eloquently\\nD written. A native English-speaker. No question about\\nD that.\\nC LARRY\\nD Uh-huh.\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD But I reiterate this, LARRY: no cause for concern. I only\\nD speak because I would have felt odd concealing it.\\nC LARRY\\nD Yes, okay, thank you Arlen.\\nO 48\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD Best to Judith.\\nN LARRY answers with a wan smile. He looks down at the Mentaculus.\\nN HEBREW SCHOOL EXTERIOR\\nN Day. Somewhere inside the school a bell rings. Its doors swing\\nN open and children\\nN emerge.\\nN Our angle is down a line of school busses, each with the the\\nN same stenciled Hebrew\\nN lettering, waiting to ferry the children home.\\nN We are tracking toward the busses to steepen the rake. As children\\nN sort themselves out\\nN and climb into their respective vehicles, the track brings the\\nS nearest bus into the fore-\\nN ground. It noisily idles with its signature squeaks and stress\\nN sounds, its low coughing\\nN engine ominously rumbling. Children start climbing on.\\nS MINUTES LATER\\nN Inside the bus, now moving. Engine noise bangs in louder and\\nN air roars in through open\\nN windows.\\nN We are on the driver, a sallow man in a short-sleeved white shirt\\nN with earlocks and a\\nN yarmulke. He pitches about, stoically wrestling with the wheel\\nN and gear shift as the\\nD vehicle bucks.\\nN The pitching children. Somewhere, Jefferson Airplane plays.\\nC DANNY\\nD I gotta get my radio back.\\nC Ronnie Nudell\\nD Maybe the fucker lodged it up his fucking asshole.\\nC DANNY\\nD I gotta get it back. Or Mike Fagle's gonna pound the crap\\nD out of me.\\nC Ronnie Nudell\\nO 49\\nN Way up his asshole.\\nC DANNY\\nD And I'll still have to get my sister the money back or she's\\nD gonna break four of my records. Twenty bucks, four\\nD records.\\nC Howard Altar\\nD How do you buy all those records. Where do you get your\\nD funds.\\nC CLOSE ON LARRY\\nN Standing in his yard. His eyes are darkly pouched. He is staring\\nN at something, it seems\\nN in distress. We hear a fluttering sound.\\nN His point-of-view: stakes are set out in the Brandts' yard. Red\\nN ribbon connecting them\\nN outlines a projection from the side of the house. The loose ends\\nN of the ribbon flutter in\\nN the breeze.\\nN Engine noise brings LARRY's look around. A car is arriving.\\nN It is the Brandts' car, oddly burdened. As it pulls into their\\nN driveway we see that there is\\nN a four-point stag strapped to the hood, its head lolling over\\nN the grille.\\nN Gar and Mitch get out of the car in their hunting fatigues. Blood\\nN is smeared on Gar's\\nN shirt.\\nM GAR\\nD Go scrub up, Mitch.\\nC LARRY\\nD Uh, good afternoon.\\nN This brings Gar's look around. Apparently he is unused to talking\\nN with his neighbor.\\nN There is a short beat before his response.\\nM GAR\\nS Afternoon.\\nN In the background of his angle is the dead buck, staring off\\nN through sightless eyes.\\nO 50\\nC LARRY\\nE (LAMELY)\\nD . Been hunting?\\nM GAR\\nD Yep.\\nC LARRY\\nD Is that a, uh...\\nN He is indicating the staked area. Gar looks around at it, looks\\nN back at LARRY.\\nM GAR\\nD Gonna be a den.\\nC LARRY\\nD Uh-huh, that's great. Uh, Mr. Brandt-\\nN Gar barks at Mitch, who has lingered to listen to the grown-ups:\\nM GAR\\nD I said scrub up, Mitch!\\nN The child quickly goes. LARRY frowns.\\nC LARRY\\nD Isn't this a school day?\\nM GAR\\nD Took him out of school today. So he could hunt with his\\nD dad.\\nC LARRY\\nD Oh!\\nE He nods.\\nD . That's.. . nice.\\nN Gar stares at him with button eyes. Small talk is not his thing.\\nN LARRY clears his throat.\\nC 51\\nN . Um, Mr. Brandt, that's just about at the property line,\\nN there. I don't think we're supposed to get within, what, ten\\nN FEET\\nM GAR\\nN Property line's the poplar.\\nC LARRY\\nD . the. ?\\nM GAR\\nD Poplar!\\nC LARRY\\nD . Well.. . even if it is, you're just about over it\\nM GAR\\nD Measure.\\nN We hear two pairs of pounding footsteps coming up the street.\\nC LARRY\\nD I don't have to measure, you can tell it's...\\nM GAR\\nD Line's the poplar.\\nN He indicates.\\nN . It's all angles.\\nN Gar Brandt turns and goes.\\nN LARRY turns, reacting to the pounding footsteps. One of the two\\nN pairs belongs to DANNY\\nN who arrives, slowing to a walk, panting, a bookbag over his shoulder.\\nN A half-block back the pursuing boy also stops running. Husky,\\nN shaggy-haired, he\\nN watches, scowling, as DANNY goes up the walk to his house.\\nN LARRY addresses DANNY's retreating back:\\nO 52\\nC LARRY\\nD What's going on?\\nC DANNY\\nD Nothing.\\nN IN THE HOUSE\\nN As LARRY enters.\\nC Judith (ofj)\\nD LARRY?\\nC LARRY\\nE (PROJECTING)\\nD Yeah?\\nC Judith (ofj)\\nD Did you go to Sieglestein Schlutz?\\nD No, I-not yet.\\nC LARRY.\\nD Appointment Monday.\\nD The thud of a car door outside.\\nN SARAH heads for the front door, pulling on a jacket. LARRY is\\nN surprised.\\nN . Where are you going?\\nC SARAH\\nD I'm going to the hole.\\nC LARRY\\nD At five o'clock?\\nN He looks out the front-door window. Four girls of SARAH's age\\nN are coming up the walk\\nO 53\\nN from the car. All have dark hair and big noses.\\nC SARAH\\nD We're stopping at Laurie Kipperstein's house so I can wash\\nD my hair.\\nN LARRY pulls open the door just as the doorbell rings. From the\\nN four dark girls:\\nC VOICES\\nD Hi, Mr. Gopnik.\\nC LARRY\\nD You can't wash it here?\\nD From somewhere in the house, Jefferson Airplane starts.\\nN As she brushes past LARRY:\\nC SARAH\\nD Uncle Arthur's in the bathroom.\\nC VOICE\\nD Out in a minute!\\nN Judith enters.\\nC JUDITH\\nD Are you ready?\\nC LARRY\\nD Huh?\\nC JUDITH\\nD We're meeting Sy at Embers.\\nC LARRY\\nD I am?\\nC JUDITH\\nD Both of us.

I think, really, the Jolly Roger is the\\nN appropriate coss of action.\\nN He shrugs.\\nN It has a pool.\\nN IN BLACK AND WHITE: A BRAIN\\nN It sits in a large fishbowl filled with clear fluid.\\nN The brain, alive, pulses. Leads connect it to various pieces\\nN of gear outside the fishbowl.\\nN Brain and appurtenances sit on a dais of sorts dressed out with\\nN bunting.\\nN Oddly, the picture is scored with cantorial singing.\\nN The brain seems to be giving orders to people who wear imperfectly\\nN form-fitting 1950's\\nN uniforms of the future. After receiving their instructions the\\nD minions of the brain\\nN kowtow before it and leave. They are succeeded by two leather-helmeted\\nN thugs, big and\\nD heavy though lacking muscle definition, who escort a resisting\\nD handsome man before the\\nN brain. The handsome man, hands tied behind his back, gazes defiantly\\nN up at the brain\\nN which in some fashion addresses him.\\nN We hear blows and voices over the cantorial music:\\nO 58\\nC DANNY\\nD Stop it!\\nC SARAH\\nD Creep fucker!\\nC DANNY\\nD Stop it!

The tone arm of DANNY's\\nS portable record\\nN player rides on a spinning LP.\\nN Wider shows LARRY grading bluebooks at a small formica table\\nN crowded into a corner of\\nN his motel room. It is a depressingly generic budget motel room\\nS of the mid-sixties with\\nN cheaply paneled walls, thin carpet, formica night tables, plastic\\nN lamps, and twin beds\\nN with stained nubby bedspreads.\\nN The phone rings.\\nC LARRY\\nD Hello...\\nE He brightens.\\nN .

He has a hand\\nN towel pressed to the\\nN back of his neck.\\nD . Oh sure, that sounds great. . . Oh, great, then I'll bring\\nN DANNY...\\nT LAKE NOKOMIS\\nN The beach: families are crowded onto the small beach of a freshwater\\nS lake, children\\nN cavorting, adults lounging, much sun, few umbrellas. Red floats\\nN connected by red nylon\\nN rope define a swimming area; beyond it people dive from an anchored\\nN raft.\\nN Splashing and children's laughter slap off the surface of the\\nN lake.\\nC WOODS\\nN Above the lake. The beach noise has some distance. It also has\\nN a faintly bizarre canyon\\nN echo. There is a present, sybillant shushing of breeze in the\\nN trees.\\nN It is dark here with intense hot spots where sun sifts through\\nN the leaf cover. We are close\\nN on DANNY, who sits very still, leaning back against a tree trunk.\\nO 63\\nN After a very long beat he slowly exhales, a small amount of smoke\\nN feathering out with his\\nN breath.\\nC VOICE\\nD Gimme that fucker.\\nN DANNY passes the joint to Ronnie Nudell, who sits opposite.\\nS PICNIC AREA\\nN On a woodless rise above the lake. Each of the separate picnic\\nN areas consist of a redwood\\nN table and benches placed next to a firepit.\\nN Here in the sun both LARRY and Mel Nudell, a man slightly older\\nN than LARRY, glisten with\\nN sweat. Mel, in the background, bounces a bag of charcoal briquettes\\nN to spill some into\\nN the firepit. LARRY sits at the table in the foreground with Mimi\\nN Nudell who alone seems\\nN unaffected by the heat-or by anything else in the physical environment.\\nN Her pale,\\nN gravely composed Giacometti face is shaded by a large-brimmed\\nN hat.\\nC LARRY\\nD No. Almost a year and a half since Touche Ross let him\\nD go. He's very good with numbers. I think his, his social\\nD skills have held him back.\\nC MIMI\\nD Such a sweet man though.\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur has a good heart. And he never complains, unlike\\nD me. Sometimes I don't give him enough credit.\\nC MIMI\\nD He tried to tell me about this thing he's working on, this,\\nD um...\\nC LARRY\\nD The Mentaculus? He says it's a, uh. a probability map.\\nD Of the universe. He asked if I could help him publish it.\\nD Um, it was a little hard for me to evaluate.\\nO 64\\nN A beat.\\nC MIMI\\nD Does he go out socially at all?\\nC LARRY\\nD He tries. He's been going to the singles mixers at Hillel\\nD House.-Well, I should talk, I'm not doing any better.\\nC MIMI\\nD How is Judith?\\nC LARRY\\nD Fine. She's fine. I'm the odd man out.\\nN Mimi smiles.\\nC MIMI\\nD Sometimes these things just aren't meant to be. And it can\\nD take a while before you feel what was always there, for\\nD better or worse.\\nC LARRY\\nD I never felt it! It was a bolt from the blue! What does that\\nD mean! Everything that I thought was one way turns out to\\nD be another!\\nC MIMI\\nD Then-it's an opportunity to learn how things really are.\\nN LARRY broods. Mimi softens.\\nN . I'm sorry-I don't mean to sound glib. It's not always\\nN easy, deciphering what God is trying to tell you.\\nC LARRY\\nD I'll say.\\nC MIMI\\nD But it's not something you have to figure out all by your-\\nD self. We're Jews, we have that well of tradition to draw on,\\nD to help us understand.

She's usually right about these\\nD things.\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD Mm-hm.\\nC LARRY\\nD I feel so... addled.\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD Yes, I can see.\\nC LARRY\\nD I was hoping that... Rabbi Nachtner...\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD That he would... yes?\\nO 68\\nC LARRY\\nD Well, with the benefit of his life experience... no\\nD OFFENSE-\\nN Rabbi Scott chuckles.\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD No, of course not. I am the junior rabbi. And it's true, the\\nD point-of-view of somebody who's older and perhaps had\\nD similar problems might be more valid. And you should see\\nD the senior rabbi as well, by all means. Or even Minda if\\nD you can get in, he's quite busy. But maybe-can I share\\nD something with you? Because I too have had the feeling of\\nD losing track of Hashem, which is the problem here. I too\\nD have forgotten how to see Him in the world. And when\\nD that happens you think, well, if I can't see Him, He isn't\\nD there any more, He's gone. But that's not the case. You\\nD just need to remember how to see Him. Am I right?\\nN He rises and goes to the window.\\nD I mean, the parking lot here. Not much to see.\\nN It is a different angle on the same parking lot we saw from the\\nC Hebrew school window.\\nD But if you imagine yourself a visitor, somebody who\\nD isn't familiar with these... autos and such... somebody\\nN still with a capacity for wonder... Someone with a fresh...\\nN perspective. That's what it is, LARRY.\\nC LARRY\\nD Um...\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD Because with the right perspective you can see Hashem,\\nD you know, reaching into the world. He is in the world, not\\nD just in shul. It souunds to me like you're looking at the\\nD world, looking at your wife, through tired eyes. It sounds\\nD like she's become a sort of... thing... a problem... a\\nD thing...\\nC LARRY\\nD Well, she's, she's seeing Sy Ableman.\\nO 69\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD Oh.\\nC LARRY\\nD She's, they're planning, that's why they want the Gett.\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD Oh. I'm sorry.\\nC LARRY\\nD It was his idea.\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD Well, they do need a Gett to remarry in the faith. But this\\nD is life. For you too. You can't cut yourself off from the\\nD mystical or you'll be-you'll remain-completely lost.\\nD You have to see these things as expressions of God's will.\\nD You don't have to like it, of course.\\nC LARRY\\nD The boss isn't always right, but he's always the boss.\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD Ha-ha-ha! That's right, things aren't so bad. Look at the\\nS parking lot, LARRY.\\nN Rabbi Scott gazes out, marveling.\\nN . Just look at that parking lot.\\nS EXTERIOR: GOPNIK HOUSE\\nN Our low angle looks across the lawn toward the front of the house.\\nN Someone's pounding\\nN footsteps approach and his feet enter just off the lens and he\\nN quickly recedes, cropping in\\nN as he races up to the house: DANNY.\\nN A beat later pursuing feet enter, slowing-for DANNY is already\\nN mounting the front\\nN stoop.

He notices something unusual.\\nN Sussman reaches up for the loupe attached to his eyeglasses.\\nN There seems to be something engraved on the inside of the\\nN patient's lower incisors...\\nN He flips down the loupe.

Nothing. His wife's mouth...\\nN Sussman's wife lies asleep on her back, her mouth open, snoring\\nN softly. Sussman, in\\nN pyjamas but with his glasses on and loupe in place, lies over\\nN her in bed, supporting\\nN himself with one arm thrown across her body. He leans awkwardly\\nN in, carefully\\nN lowering a dental mirror into his wife's open mouth.\\nN . Nothing. It is a singular event. A mystery.\\nN The Jefferson Airplane guitar solo is heating up.\\nN But Sussman is an educated man. Not the world's greatest\\nN sage, maybe, no Rabbi Minda, but he knows a thing or two\\nN from the Zohar and the Caballah. He knows every Hebrew\\nN letter has its numeric equivalent.\\nN Sussman, still in his pyjamas is sitting at the kitchen table\\nN scribbling on a tablet of lined\\nD paper.\\nN Close on the paper: the Hebrew letters have been transcribed\\nO into their numeric\\nO EQUIVALENTS:\\nO 496-2428\\nN Nachtner continues in voice-over:\\nO 86\\nS Seven digits-a phone number maybe?\\nN Sussman reaches for the phone.

A tzadik-who knows, maybe even a lamid vovnik-a\\nD man beloved by all, a man who despised the frivolous?\\nD Could such a serious man... simply... disappear?\\nD The words echo.\\nN Again the rabbi gazes around, as if awaiting answer.\\nN THEN:\\nN . We speak of L'olam ha-ba, the World to Come. Not\\nN heaven. Not what the gentiles think of as afterlife.\\nN \\\"L'olam ha-ba.\\\" What is L'olam ha-ba? Where is L'olam\\nN ha-ba?

As you know, the mourner's kaddish does not mention\\nN the dead. It praises Hashem; it praises what abides. And\\nN Sy Ableman, whose spirit will continue to assist us in\\nN tikkun olam, is with us even now, a serious man who would\\nN say as we now say Yiskadal v'yiskadash sh'may rabah...\\nN The congregation begins to chant along but it and Judith's weeping\\nN are cut off by:\\nN A HAND RAPPING AT A DOOR\\nN The front door to the Gopnik home.\\nN LARRY, still in his suit from shul and wearing a yarmulka, opens\\nN the door.

Inside the house we can see a corner\\nN of a card table set up in\\nN the living room with food laid out on it. SARAH sits with her\\nN back to us, head wrapped by\\nN a towel-turban. Arthur, on the far side of the table, his balding\\nN head domed by a yarmul-\\nN ka, half-leans out so that he may sneak looks toward the men\\nN at the door without totally\\nN revealing himself. From somewhere down the hall come Judith's\\nN muffled sobs.\\nD . Are you Arthur Gopnik?\\nC LARRY\\nD I'm...

Don projects:\\nD Yeah?\\nN The door cracks open. A pipe edges in, followed by a peeking\\nN face: Solomon Schlutz.\\nN . Oh, good! Sol, come on in.\\nN Solomon Schlutz is a large man in shirtsleeves and suspenders.\\nN He has the smooth\\nN impassive face of a sphynx with a pipe clenched in its teeth.\\nN He glides into the room, a sheaf of files tucked under one arm.\\nN . Sol has been looking into the property-line issues.. .\\nN Solomon Schlutz seats himself at the conference table and starts\\nN sorting and arranging\\nN the files into three piles.\\nD . It seems that you do have a real problem with the\\nN original survey. But Sol seems to think there's some kind\\nN of nifty way for us to-well, I haven't heard it myself, I'll\\nN let Sol map it out.\\nN Solomon Schlutz continues to arrange the files, his eye occasionally\\nN lingering on a\\nN specific page. When at length he is finished he carefully justifies\\nN the edges of the closest\\nN pile, takes the pipe out of his mouth, gives LARRY a smile that\\nN seems to take some effort,\\nN and then taps the pipe in a large glass ashtray.\\nN He looks up again at LARRY, this time shocked.

In the ensuing beat, quiet except for the clicking of\\nN the blinds, she is perfectly\\nN still. Finally, only her mouth moves:\\nC Mrs. Samsky\\nD How thoughtful.\\nN LARRY shrugs off the compliment.\\nC LARRY\\nD Oh it's nothing. It's just good to know your neighbors.\\nD And to help. Help others. Although I don't care much for\\nD my neighbors on the other side, I must say.\\nN Mrs. Samsky lets another smiling silence pass before responding.\\nC Mrs. Samsky\\nD .

That is a siren.\\nS OUTSIDE\\nN The Samsky's door opens and LARRY stumbles out. He stares.\\nN The police car has stopped in front of his own house next door,\\nN lights still flashing. Two\\nN cops are going up the walk with Uncle Arthur between them in\\nN handcuffs.\\nN LARRY, stunned, walks woodenly toward his house.\\nC LARRY\\nD Hey!\\nD Neither the cops nor Uncle Arthur has heard.

LARRY is mortified:\\nN CLIVE, please! Wait outside!\\nN Mrs. Samsky blows smoke into LARRY's eyes. The screen goes black.\\nN Close on LARRY as he opens his eyes. A shadow falls across his\\nN face.\\nN His point-of-view: a wooden plank is just being slid into place\\nN over his head. The bang\\nN of hammer on nailhead. In the black:\\nO 117\\nN Sy Ableman's Voice\\nD Nailing it down is so impawtant.\\nN We hear the chanting of Kaddish and the sound of dirt hitting\\nN the top of the coffin.

She closes the door on the motionless\\nN rabbi and sits\\nN down, heavily, behind her own desk.\\nN SECRETARY\\nN The rabbi is busy.\\nC LARRY\\nD He didn't look busy!\\nN As she starts shuffling papers:\\nC SECRETARY\\nN He's thinking.\\nS NIGHT\\nN Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut.\\nO 119\\nN We are booming down on LARRY, asleep in bed.\\nN We hear weeping, soft, suppressed.\\nN LARRY stirs. He opens his eyes.\\nN After a groggy beat he reacts to the weeping. He looks over.\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur... ? Arthur?\\nN Arthur is a dim mound on the next bed. His weeping continues.\\nN For no reason LARRY continues to keep his voice to a whisper:\\nN . Arthur. What's wrong?\\nN No answer.\\nN . Arthur. It'll be okay. Arthur. We'll get Ron\\nN Meshbesher. It'll be okay-\\nC ARTHUR\\nD AAAHHHH!\\nN Shockingy loud, the scream is hard to interpret.\\nN Arthur flings off his bedclothes. He leaps from the bed and runs\\nN to the door. In boxer\\nN shorts and undershirt he flings the door open and runs out of\\nN the room.\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur!\\nN LARRY leaps from his bed, also in his underwear.\\nN He goes to the door but pauses, peering cautiously outside. Satisfied\\nN that the courtyard is\\nN deserted, he plunges into it.\\nS COURTYARD\\nN The courtyard/parking lot is hardlit by ghastly mercury vapor\\nN lights. The pool,\\nN surrounded by chain-link fence, has been drained. Its white concrete\\nN interior is cracked\\nO 120\\nD and weedy.\\nN Uncle Arthur is hunched weeping in a corner of the pool enclosure.\\nC LARRY\\nE (HISSING)\\nD Arthur!\\nN He opens the creaking gate and scurries over to Arthur.\\nD . You've got to pull yourself together!\\nN Arthur is suddenly angry. His voice bounces off the concrete:\\nC ARTHUR\\nD It's all shit, LARRY! It's all shit!\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur. Don't use that word.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD It's all fucking shit!\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur! Come on!\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Look at everything Hashem has given you! And what do I\\nD get! I get fucking shit!\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur. What do I have. I live at the Jolly Roger.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD You've got a family. You've got a job. Hashem hasn't\\nD given me bupkes.\\nC LARRY\\nD It's not fair to blame Hashem, Arthur. Please. Sometimes\\nD -please calm down-sometimes you have to help your-\\nD self.\\nC ARTHUR\\nC 121\\nD Don't blame me! You fucker!\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur. Please.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Hashem hasn't given me shit. Now I can't even play cards.\\nN He starts weeping again.\\nN LARRY looks around.\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur. This isn't the right forum. Please. Not by the\\nD pool.\\nC Arthur weeps.\\nD Arthur... It's okay... It's okay...\\nS MORNING\\nN LARRY and Arthur are driving. We are looking at the two of them\\nN square through a\\nN windshield in which towering conifers stream by in reflection.\\nN It seems to be a glorious\\nN day.\\nC LARRY\\nD Is this it?\\nN Both men peer out.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD I think so... yeah... there...\\nN He indicates the road ahead.\\nN A SIGNPOST\\nN The old-fashioned kind with wooden fingers pointing the different\\nN directions.\\nN One points toward CANADA.\\nO 122\\nN We tip off the sign as LARRY's car passes and recedes. There\\nN is a canoe strapped to its\\nN roof.\\nN BOUNDARY WATERS\\nD Beautiful, wooded, remote.\\nN The car is parked at water's edge, having backed down a lane\\nN of two tracks worn\\nN through the undergrowth. LARRY and Arthur are lowering the canoe\\nN into water.\\nC LARRY\\nD Okay.. .\\nN He straightens. Arthur straightens. LARRY hugs him.\\nN .Look...\\nN They separate and LARRY pulls a white envelope from his pocket\\nN and gives it to Arthur.\\nN . This'll help you get back on your feet.\\nN Arthur looks into the envelope.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Oh my God. Where did you get this?\\nC LARRY\\nD Doesn't matter. When you-\\nC ARTHUR\\nD This is a lot of money!\\nC LARRY\\nD It should get you started.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD This is a lot of money! Are you sure you don't need it?\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur, I'm fine. Come on, get in. When you're settled...\\nO 123\\nN Arthur climbs into the canoe.\\nD . let me know how to get in touch.\\nN He helps push the boat off. Arthur is twisted around, looking\\nN back. As he drifts off:\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Are you sure this is okay?\\nC LARRY\\nD It's fine. It's fine...\\nN LARRY waves.\\nN Arthur waves bravely back, then turns to pick up the oars. A\\nN couple of strokes and he\\nN turns back again with a last thought. He calls:\\nC ARTHUR\\nN LARRY. I'm sorry. What I said last night.\\nC LARRY\\nD I know. It's okay.\\nN A lingering look from Arthur, and then he turns back to row.\\nN A gunshot.\\nN Blood spurts from the back of Uncle Arthur's neck.\\nN He slumps forward, dead.\\nC VOICE\\nS Good shot!\\nN LARRY looks wildly around. He sees:\\nN Gar Brandt and Mitch in their camo fatigues, hard to pick out\\nN in the foliage. They are\\nN looking off toward the canoe, Mitch just lowering his rifle.\\nN Gar Brandt's look swings around, into the lens. He points at\\nN us:\\nN There's another Jew, son.\\nO 124\\nN Mitch swings his rifle toward us.\\nN He fires.\\nC LARRY\\nD Gasping awake in the motel room.\\nN He looks around.\\nN It is dawn.\\nN Arthur sits on the edge of his bed in his underwear, staring\\nN off into space, slackjawed,\\nN vacant-eyed, drained.\\nN LARRY gazes around the room, waiting for things to fall into\\nN place.\\nN Finally, blearily:\\nC LARRY\\nD Were we... out at the pool last night?\\nN Arthur, still staring off, responds in a flat, empty voice:\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Yes. I'm sorry.\\nN LARRY blinks sleep away.\\nN After a beat:\\nC LARRY\\nD It's shabbas.\\nD Another beat.\\nN Arthur heaves a deep sigh.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD I'll go drain my cyst.\\nO 125\\nS RESTROOM\\nS Day. A two-urinal, two-stall men's room of old tile and yellowed\\nN fixtures.\\nN We are low. One of the stall doors is closed. Under it we see\\nN the dress shoes and dress\\nN pants of two young men standing inside.\\nN We hear a long sucking inhale.\\nN Ronnie Nudell's Voice\\nD Gimme that fucker.\\nN A loudly projected echoing male voice:\\nN VOICE\\nD Ya'amod hab'rayshit.\\nS SANCTUARY\\nN DANNY, seated in the second pew next to his parents and sister\\nN and Uncle Arthur, rises\\nN and shuffles along the row to the aisle. His eyes are wide and\\nN red-rimmed.\\nN The prelapped voice was his call to the torah. All eyes in the\\nN congregation, which fills\\nN the large sanctuary, are on him.\\nN In great echoing silence he walks to the steps on the right side\\nN of the bema and climbs.\\nN The right-side lectern is surrounded by a gaggle of old Jewish\\nN men. They busy\\nN themselves with the preparation of the pair of scrolls on the\\nN lectern, rolling them,\\nN pausing, rolling some more, muttering prayers, kissing the scrolls\\nN by means of their\\nN tsitsim. They pay DANNY no attention.\\nN DANNY takes his place centered behind the lectern. His chin comes\\nN up to the bottom of\\nS the reading platform.\\nN Men continue to mutter prayers around him. A pair of hands appear\\nN on his shoulders\\nN from behind. DANNY looks down at the strange hands. They pull\\nN him back.\\nN A foot drags a small riser out from under the lectern.\\nN Hands push DANNY up onto the riser.\\nO 126\\nN Booming up on the torah scrolls, still being busily rolled.\\nN Beyond it, a sea of faces.\\nN The yad-a molded tin pointer-is thrust into DANNY's hand. The\\nN non-pointing end has\\nN a red silken tassel.\\nN DANNY looks at the bouncing tassel. He looks at the little pointing\\nN finger which is the\\nN business end of the yad.\\nN Men mutter around him, each a different prayer. They dip and\\nN doven.\\nN DANNY watches himself point the yad down at the scroll.\\nN The scroll is a dense swarm of Hebrew letters. DANNY squints.\\nN One voice separates from the murmurs around him. It chants, insistently,\\nN in a sotto-voce\\nN FALSETTO:\\nD VOICE\\nN Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot...\\nN DANNY is still staring at the end of the yad against the parchment\\nN scroll.\\nN Someone's hand enters and moves the yad to a different place\\nN in the text.\\nN The voice repeats:\\nN . Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot...\\nN DANNY looks up from the scrolls.\\nN In the congregation Ronnie Nudell sits hunched-shouldered and\\nN squished between his\\nN parents. He returns DANNY's red-rimmed slack-jawed stare.\\nN The insistent voice:\\nN . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot...\\nN DANNY looks over.\\nN From the surrounding scrum the prompter nods at him. He looks\\nN somewhat like Cantor\\nC Youssele Rosenblatt.\\nO 127\\nN . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot.. .\\nN DANNY looks back down at the scroll. A hand enters to tap a pointing\\nN finger where the\\nD yad points.\\nS . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effa-\\nN DANNY suddenly erupts:\\nC DANNY\\nD Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot. .\\nC PROMPTER\\nD Mm-hm.\\nN DANNY continues to boom out the torah portion. He moves the yad\\nN along the line of\\nS letters.\\nN In the congregation, LARRY and Judith watch. We hear DANNY chanting\\nN fluently and\\nN LARRY squeezes the hand Judith has laced through his arm.\\nN Juith whispers:\\nC JUDITH\\nD I'm sorry that... things have been so hard for us...\\nC LARRY\\nD It's okay.\\nC JUDITH\\nN Sy had so much respect for you, LARRY.\\nN He pats her hand.\\nN A beat.\\nN . He wrote letters to the tenure committee.\\nO LATER\\nN The congregation is loudly singing V'Zos Hatorah. A tallised\\nN man of late middle age\\nO 128\\nN hoists the open scroll from the lectern and raises it high, turning\\nN his back on the\\nN congregation so that all may see it.\\nN DANNY has been ensconced in a highbacked chair upstage on the\\nN bema.\\nN His point-of-view of the man holding the torah is close and steeply\\nN raked. The man is\\nN sweating. The heavy scrolls vibrate slightly from his effort\\nN to keep them aloft. As the\\nN congregation continues to sing he mutters under his breath:\\nC MAN\\nD Jesus Christ.. .\\nD LATER\\nN DANNY stands behind the left lectern facing Rabbi Nachtner who\\nN holds a small kiddush\\nN cup out to him.\\nN Although Rabbi Nachtner seems to be addressing DANNY, he is projecting\\nN loudly.\\nC NACHTNER\\nD . taking your place as a member of our tribe. You will\\nD go and see Rabbi Minda after the service. You will cele-\\nD brate in a reception downstairs in Schanfield Hall. And\\nD then you will be a member of B'Nai Abraham and of the\\nD Nation of Israel.

The cut has snapped off the robust Adon Olam,\\nN leaving sepulchral quiet.\\nN DANNY, clutching his kiddush cup, hesitantly enters the dim study.\\nN Minda's elderly\\nN eastern European gatekeeper closes the door behind him.\\nN Minda is an old man staring at him from behind a bare desktop.\\nN His look, eyes\\nN magnified by thick glasses, is impossible to read.\\nN DANNY creeps to the chair facing the desk. He gingerly sits on\\nN the squeaking leather\\nN upholstery, self-conscious under Minda's stare.\\nN Minda breathes regularly through his mouth. It is the only sound\\nN in the room.\\nN A long beat. The two sit face to face.\\nN Minda smacks his lips a couple of times, preparing to speak.\\nN Another beat.\\nN FINALLY:\\nC MINDA\\nD When the truth is found. To be lies.\\nN He pauses. He clears his throat.\\nO At length:\\nN . And all the hope. Within you dies.\\nN Another beat. DANNY waits. Minda stares.\\nN He smacks his lips again.\\nN . Then what?\\nN DANNY doesn't answer. It is unclear whether the question was\\nN directed at him.\\nN Quiet.\\nO 130\\nN Minda clears his throat with a loud and thorough hawking.\\nN The hawking abates. Minda sniffs.\\nN . Grace Slick. Marty Balin. Paul Kanta. Jorma...\\nN somethin. These are the membas of the Airplane.\\nN He nods a couple of times.\\nN . Interesting.\\nN He reaches up and slowly opens his desk drawer. He takes something\\nN out. He lays it on\\nN the bare desk and pushes it partway across.\\nN . Here.\\nN It is DANNY's radio.\\nN . Be a good boy.\\nS LARRY'S OFFICE\\nN LARRY is at his desk sorting through mail.\\nC Arlen Finkle (off\\nD DANNY was magnificent.\\nN LARRY looks up: Arlen is leaning in his accustomed spot in the\\nN office doorway.\\nC LARRY\\nD Oh.

Get outta here.\\nE (to ANNIE)\\nD Don't worry about him.  He's harmless.\\nE (back to Ralph)\\nD G'won.

OIL TRUCK - DAY\\nN As the truck pulls away, we see RALPH through the windshield,\\nN standing at the edge of the road.  He is angry and upset now.\\nN He pats his rats.\\nN The OIL MAN shifts, looks over and smiles.  His two front teeth\\nN are missing on top.\\nC OIL MAN\\nD Must be the fourth time somebody's tried\\nD to reopen that place.\\nC ANNIE\\nD Camp Crystal Lake?\\nN He nods.\\nC OIL MAN\\nD Something always happens up there.\\nN He turns on the radio in the cab and we hear the DJ again.\\nC DJ (V.O.)\\nD ...of bed.

Thanks a lot for the lift.\\nN He nods and shakes his head with the sense of what might have\\nN been if he were thirty years younger.  He puts it in gear and\\nN roars off.\\nN ANNIE looks around and sees an old gas station.  It is closed.\\nN There's a sign which reads:  \\\"No Gas 'Til Sat.\\\"  A mangey dog\\nN sits on the stoop watching ANNIE.\\nN ANNIE kneels down and calls the dog.  The dog comes.  ANNIE\\nN pets him and then heads off up the road.\\nN The dog watches her go.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 15    EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY\\nN ANNIE is beginning to get worried about the time.

JEEP - DAY\\nN From the DRIVER'S POV, we see ANNIE waiting for a lift.  The\\nN DRIVER, unseen, shifts down until ANNIE is alongside.  The\\nN Jeep, an uncovered model, stops.  ANNIE smiles a big delicious\\nN smile at us as we sit in the DRIVER's seat.\\nC ANNIE\\nD Hiya!  I'm headed for Camp Crystal Lake.\\nN Can you help me out?\\nN Apparently the DRIVER nods, because ANNIE beams at us.  She\\nN tosses her pack in the back and hops aboard.  The DRIVER\\nN accelerates.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 17    EXT. RURAL ROADS - DAY\\nN The Jeep roars along the road.  The sun and shadows keep us\\nN from seeing the DRIVER.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 18    INT. JEEP - DAY\\nN Still in the DRIVER's POV, the CAMERA watches as ANNIE looks\\nN around, admires the woods, the Jeep, the day.  Things are going\\nN her way.\\nC ANNIE\\nD I can't remember being this excited\\nD about anything.  I want to be a teacher\\nD when I finish at Southern State.  I\\nD guess I've always wanted to work with\\nD children.  I hate it when people call\\nD 'em kids.  Sounds like little goats.\\nN The forest outside the speeding Jeep is deeper and signs of\\nN civilization have all but disappeared.  ANNIE still turns and\\nN looks at the CAMERA when she speaks to the DRIVER.\\nC ANNIE\\nE (continuing)\\nD The job market for teachers is supposed\\nD to be the pits these days, but I don't\\nD care.  When you have a dream as long as\\nD I have, you'll do anything...\\nN A look of surprise passes ANNIE's young face.\\nC ANNIE\\nE (continuing)\\nD Wasn't that Camp Crystal Lake?

She looks over her\\nN shoulder to see the Jeep.  The sun flares on the Jeep's\\nN windshield, keeping us from being able to see any details of\\nN the DRIVER.\\nN In a final desperate move, ANNIE drives into the underbrush to\\nN escape.\\nN The Jeep skids to a stop.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 25    EXT. ROADSIDE/WOODS - DAY\\nN The CAMERA becomes the DRIVER and chases into the thicket.\\nN Branches and briars snap back at us.  Just ahead, the terror-\\nN stuck ANNIE stumbles and falls.  She screams as a knife flashes\\nN past her in a blur.\\nN When the knife has passed, all we can see is a look of surprise\\nN on ANNIE's face.\\nN The CAMERA PULLS BACK.  Her throat has been cut.  She collapses\\nN out of FRAME.\\nN A bird soars across the sky above.\\nN The TRACK is SILENT.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 26    EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY\\nN A gaily decorated camper-van travels along the highway.

CAMPER VAN - DAY\\nN In the camper van are three young people.  They are full of\\nN fun, fresh and expectant as they head towards Crystal Lake.\\nN They are instantly likeable.\\nN At the wheel is NED, a short 22-year-old whose well-developed\\nN upper body is a tribute to his weight-lifting.  He is nice-\\nN looking, a joker who is always trying to get some attraction.\\nN He is funny and alert.\\nN Next to him is JACK, an athlete whose clean-cut look is as\\nN American as popcorn.  He is quieter, two years younger and not\\nN as smart as NED.  He has to think things through.\\nN MARCIE is JACK's girlfriend.  She is leaning over the front\\nN passenger seat so she can messenger JACK's shoulders.\\nN She is a funny girl, pretty, and always looking for fun.  She\\nN enjoys every minute of every day.  She hasn't been touched by\\nN tragedy.\\nC MARCIE\\nD Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.\\nC NED\\nD There you are dead wrong.\\nC JACK\\nD Ha!\\nC NED\\nD Sometimes I only think about kissing\\nD women.\\nN MARCIE finds a sore spot on JACK's back.\\nC JACK\\nD Ow!\\nC NED\\nD I was just wondering if you thought\\nD there'd by any other gorgeous women at\\nD Camp Crystal Lake.  Besides yourself.\\nC MARCIE\\nD You are a true pierce of work, Ned.\\nN MARCIE hits NED on the arms, playfully.\\nC MARCIE\\nE (continuing)\\nD How about our last jay?\\nC JACK\\nD Good call.\\nN JACK reaches into the glove compartment and comes out with a\\nN joint.\\nC NED\\nD What about the dope paragraph in Mr.\\nD Christy's letter?\\nC JACK\\nD Quote:  Controlled substances are\\nD expressly forbidden.  Possession or use\\nD of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds\\nD will means instant dismissal.  Unquote.\\nC MARCIE\\nD We got two weeks before the kids even\\nD arrive.

CAMP DRIVE - DAY\\nN The CAMERA SEES what NED saw.  The buildings are run down at\\nN the heels.  It is the same camp we saw in the early scenes, but\\nN time has torn the place badly.\\nN The van passes the CAMERA and we see the three new ARRIVALS\\nN looking out the window.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 31    EXT. MAIN CAMP AREA - DAY\\nN This is the main building.  It is the building where Barry and\\nN Claudette met.  Outside is a flagpole, a small parking area, a\\nN large overhanging tree.\\nN In the BG we can see part of the lake.\\nN In the FG there is a Jeep.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 32    EXT. CAMP MAIN AREA - DAY\\nN An axe flashes through the FRAME and hacks apart the halves of\\nN a huge tree stump.\\nN The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a middle-aged man in cut-offs,\\nN a bare chest, hiking boots and beat-up cowboy hat.  This is\\nN STEVE CHRISTY.  He is strong, charming, and engaging.  He is\\nN animated, always in motion, impatient with how long it takes to\\nN do things.\\nN In the BG the van comes to a stop.  No sooner has JACK hopped\\nN down, than STEVE is beckoning him over.\\nC STEVE\\nD Wanta give me a hand here?\\nN JACK smiles and comes quickly.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD Alice?\\nN NED steps down from the van and now we can see that he has had\\nN polio when he was a kid.  His upper body is strong, but his\\nN legs are slightly deformed.  He and MARCIE hustle over to the\\nN big stump.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD Wanta roll this sucker out of the way.\\nD Alice?\\nN ALICE comes into the MS.  She is carrying a shovel and a bucket\\nN and has obviously been working for a couple of hours.\\nC ALICE\\nN Cabin B is ready.\\nC STEVE\\nN Push on this side.  Alice, this is Jack,\\nN Marcie and Ned.  Push.\\nN They exchange \\\"hellos\\\" as they bend to the work.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD That's got her.  Thanks.  I'm Steve\\nD Christy.  Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.\\nD You got some grubby clothes?  Climb into\\nN 'em.  Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out\\nN the boathouse.  I want him to start with\\nN the canoes.  What happened to Brenda?\\nC ALICE\\nD You told her to sweep the courts.\\nN STEVE sets off.\\nC STEVE\\nD I'd rather she painted.  Let's go, folks.\\nN As soon as he's gone, NED turns to ALICE.\\nC NED\\nD I thought we had two weeks...\\nN ALICE shrugs.\\nC ALICE\\nD You can changed in three.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 33    EXT. EDGE OF LAKE - DAY\\nN The CAMERA looks down a long line of canoes, each with its hull\\nN up.  A brush slaps into view.  BILL is sweating while finishing\\nN a coat of paint on the last canoe.\\nN BILL is a thin, ascetic-looking college sophomore.  He rubs his\\nN long thin rose with the back of his wrist as he hears someone\\nN call his name OS.  He turns to see ALICE at the bottom of the\\nN trail.\\nC ALICE\\nD Steve said for you to start on the boats.\\nC BILL\\nD I finished the boats.\\nN ALICE nods slowly.\\nC ALICE\\nD I'll tell him.\\nN She turns away.\\nC BILL\\nD Alice?  The others show up?\\nC ALICE\\nD Everybody except the girl who's supposed\\nN to handle the kitchen.  Annie.\\nN BILL puts his brush in a coffee can of turps.\\nN ALICE look at him, then turns again.\\nC BILL\\nD You think you're gonna last all summer?\\nC ALICE\\nD I'm not sure I'll last all week.\\nE (pauses)\\nD I'll tell Steve.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 34    EXT. GIRL'S CABIN - DAY\\nN STEVE and NED are rehanging a door.  Next to them is BRENDA, a\\nN dark Eurasian girl who is trying to do a good job of painting\\nN the wall.  On the other side MARCIE is scraping some flaking\\nN paint.\\nC STEVE\\nD Shim it up just a scooch.\\nN NED levers the door higher at the top.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD Perfection.  Hold it.\\nN STEVE uses a long ratchet screwdriver.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD To answer your question, my parents once\\nD owned this camp.  There were some tragic\\nD accidents and they went bankrupt.  I\\nD promised them I'd reopen if I could.\\nD See if it closes right now.\\nN NED swings the door on its hinges.\\nC NED\\nD Looks good.\\nC STEVE\\nD Perfection. Did you meet Brenda?\\nN BRENDA turns and nods.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD She's archery.  He's rifle ranged.  And\\nD I'm behind schedule.  Let's go, Ned.\\nN They exit with the tool box.  MARCIE stops and turns to BRENDA,\\nN who looks upward and blows the hair from her forehead.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 35    EXT. EDGE OF THE LAKE - DAY\\nN STEVE, ALICE, BRENDA, MARCIE, NED, JACK and BILL are lugging a\\nN swimming float down to the water's edge.  STEVE supervises as\\nN he carries the thing, which is quite heavy.  They ad-lid as\\nN appropriate.  (\\\"There goes my hernia.\\\" \\\"Are you sure you're\\nN lifting?\\\" \\\"Not so fast.\\\" \\\"I'm walking backward.\\\")\\nN They drop the things carefully.\\nC STEVE\\nD Come on back here and let's above the\\nD float in.\\nN They get behind it and shove it into the water.  NED hops\\nN aboard for the ride, flipping into a handstand.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 36    INT. EQUIPMENT SHED - DAY\\nN The screen has gone completely black.  The door to the shed is\\nN whipped open quickly, letting in the full brightness of the\\nN sun.  There is a shape.\\nN The CAMERA IRISES DOWN so that we can see that JACK has come in\\nN on an errand.\\nN As JACK looks around, we can take the time to see that there\\nN are a half-dozen lantern, a few cans of lantern fuel, a couple\\nN of hibachis, some entrenching tools packs, portable ice chests,\\nN etc.  Up on the long side wall are a half-dozen hunting knives\\nN in sheathes, also hanging neatly.\\nN Suddenly a hand comes into FRAME and touches JACK on the\\nN shoulder as he is preoccupied with his task.  JACK turns with\\nN a start.  He looks into the CAMERA.\\nN REVERSE POV to see MARCIE standing in the doorway.\\nC MARCIE\\nD What are those for?  An Indian raid?\\nN She points to the row of hatchets and knives.\\nC JACK\\nD Steve's got a woodlore program.  You see\\nD any life rings?\\nN MARCIE looks behind some piled up equipment.  She pulls out two\\nN rings.\\nC MARCIE\\nD Here.  Meet me in my cabin after taps.\\nD Okay, Camper?\\nN She kisses him on the cheek and gives him a playful goose.\\nC JACK\\nD For sure.\\nN They exit together.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 37    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - DAY\\nN STEVE CHRISTY comes upon ALICE, who is renailing floorboards on\\nN the porch of the Arts & Crafts cabin.  On the railing is a\\nN sketch pad which Steve thumbs through.\\nN INSERT:  ALICE'S SKETCH.  It is a moody pierce, a sense of\\nN foreboding dominates it.  Otherwise, it is the camp's central\\nN compound, featuring the tree that forms the central focus.\\nC STEVE\\nD You draw very well.\\nC ALICE\\nD Oh, thanks.  I wish I could spend more\\nD time at it.\\nN ALICE misses a nail and hits her thumb.  She reacts good-\\nN naturedly and keeps on working.\\nN STEVE bends down next to ALICE.\\nC STEVE\\nD This isn't your cup of tea, hunh?\\nN She shakes her head.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD Any particular reason?\\nC ALICE\\nD Just a feeling.\\nE (pause)\\nD Nothing personal.\\nC STEVE\\nE (nodding)\\nD You want to leave?\\nC ALICE\\nD I don't know.

Stay a week.  Help get it\\nD ready.  Next Friday, if you're not\\nD happy, I'll put you on the bus myself.\\nD I'll be grateful.\\nN He puts out a hand and runs the back of it across her cheek.\\nN She looks up.  She nods.\\nC ALICE\\nN Next Friday.\\nC STEVE\\nD Thanks, Alice.\\nN He stands up.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD I've got to go to town and pick up the\\nD trailer and all that other stuff, but\\nD I'll be back around ten.  If you're\\nD still up, we can talk, okay?\\nC ALICE\\nO Sure.\\nN She watches him cross out of FRAME.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 38    EXT. MAIN CABIN AREA - DAY (LATER)\\nN STEVE is at the wheel of his Jeep.  The COUNSELLORS are\\nN standing within earshot, huddled around the Jeep.\\nC JACK\\nD You want it listed separately?\\nC STEVE\\nD Yeah.  Brenda, after lunch hit the\\nD archery range.  If Annie gets here, have\\nD her start in on the kitchen.  Do your\\nD best.  Tomorrow we have a preliminary\\nS inspection by the state safety people.\\nD I'd like to look good.\\nN He wheels the car around and out the driveway.  The others\\nN stand looking before NED breaks the silence.\\nC NED\\nD He neglected to mention this place is\\nD called \\\"Camp Blood\\\" downtown.\\nN They are all getting back to work.\\nC ALICE\\nD How come?\\nC NED\\nD Some campers drowned.  Then some\\nD counsellors got killed.\\nC BILL\\nD No shit.  When?\\nC NED\\nD Late fifties sometime.  They never\\nD caught the guy who did it either.\\nC MARCIE\\nD Neddy collects weird facts.  Next he is\\nD going to tell us that there are poisonous\\nD snakes in the outhouse and green lizards\\nD in the lake.\\nN As they laugh, the CAMERA HOLDS on ALICE.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 39    EXT. ARCHERY RANGE - DAY\\nN BRENDA has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job.  She\\nN enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of\\nN this area.  She likes to think of herself as more sophisticated\\nN than she is--or have others think her more sophisticated.\\nN BRENDA rolls a straw target out from under the lean-to shelter\\nN and heads for a tripod in the middle distance.  There are\\nN already two such targets out, a product of her efforts so far.\\nN The targets are heavy.  This isn't an easy one-person job.\\nN The CAMERA CLOSES IN tighter and tighter on her as she gets\\nN closer to setting up the target.\\nN In MCU, she lifts a target up.  Her head is very close to the\\nN face of the target.  She gets it up, lets the tripod take the\\nN weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow\\nN streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by\\nN eighteen inches.\\nN BRENDA whips around.\\nN WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  a very cocky NED, standing by the lean-\\nN to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked\\nN simultaneously.  He has a feather stuck in his hair.\\nN She grabs the arrow and storms at him.\\nC BRENDA\\nD You're crazy!\\nN She snaps the arrow in half.\\nC NED\\nD Did anyone ever tell you you're\\nD beautiful when you're angry?\\nC BRENDA\\nE (plussed)\\nD I don't believe you...\\nC NED\\nD Want to see my trick shot?  It's even\\nD better.\\nN BRENDA still thinks he's a jerk, but he's so outrageous there's\\nN little she can do.  She laughs.\\nC BRENDA\\nE (still laughing)\\nD You ever fire one of those bows again,\\nD and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.\\nC NED\\nD God, but I love that sexy talk.\\nN BRENDA snatches the bow from him, shakes her head and puts the\\nN bow down next to a collection of wicked-looking arrows.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 40    INT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - DAY\\nN This is a fairly large single room.  The walls are bare and\\nN uninsulated.  There are a few easels, but for the most part,\\nN the room is dominated by long tables and rough-hewn benches.\\nN The light seeps through the streaked windows, making the grey\\nN wood interior appear silver-colored.  ALICE, her hair in a\\nN bandana, has just finished sweeping up.\\nN The CAMERA picks up on ALICE's sketch of the central camp area\\nN on one easel.  On a second easel she has done the preliminary\\nN sketch of the lake itself.  It is also a moody picture.\\nN ALICE cocks her head to look at the sketches, shivers just a\\nN little, then goes on to her next task.  There is a row of newly-\\nN arrived cardboard boxes.  She opens the first in CU with a\\nN matte knife.  She take out the invoice and checks it against\\nN the first items:  gimp, the plastic string from which all the\\nN campers will make lanyards.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 41    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - DAY\\nN We watch through one of the dusty panes, seeing the charcoal\\nN sketch in the FG, ALICE in the BG checking her materials\\nN against her invoice.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 42    INT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - DAY (INTERCUT)\\nN ALICE snaps around, sensing that she is being watched.  In CU\\nN her frightened face looks at the sun-drenched dusty pane.  Her\\nN face relaxes until BANG!  The sound of a door slamming echoes\\nN through the room.\\nN The CAMERA ZOOMS BACK from her face to see someone standing in\\nN the doorway.\\nN It is BILL.\\nC BILL\\nD Sorry.  How you doing?\\nN ALICE smiles, then turns back to her job of taking inventory.\\nN BILL watches her.\\nC ALICE\\nD Did you want something?\\nN She starts to take a box down from a high shelf.  She doesn't\\nN realize that there is something on top of the box.\\nC BILL\\nD Steve said you were thinking of leaving.\\nD True?\\nC ALICE\\nD Un-hunh.\\nN ALICE lugs down the box and suddenly a bunch of leather-working\\nN tools clatters down, shattering the silence.  ALICE fends off\\nN the flying implements and BILL rushes to her side.\\nC ALICE\\nE (continuing)\\nD Oh, my God...\\nC BILL\\nD You okay?\\nN She nods.\\nC BILL\\nE (continuing)\\nD You're lucky.\\nN They stoop down to pick up the fallen tools from the floor.\\nN BILL looks at her while they work.\\nC BILL\\nE (continuing)\\nD How come you're leaving?\\nC ALICE\\nD It's long and personal.  It has nothing\\nD to do with you or the other kids.\\nC BILL\\nD Maybe I can help?\\nN ALICE looks at BILL and smiles.  This really is a very nice, if\\nN naive, young man.\\nC ALICE\\nD And it's this place.  It makes no sense,\\nN but it spooks me.\\nC BILL\\nE (smiling)\\nD You're right.  It makes no sense.\\nN As ALICE nods, she is interrupted by a shrill scream outside.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 43    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - DAY\\nN MARCIE is the source of the scream.  She runs towards the\\nN CAMERA, dressed in cut-offs and a floral halter.  Her feet are\\nN bare.  When she get closer, we see that she is being chased by\\nN JACK and NED who have found two giant green bullfrogs.  The\\nN screams were not serious and MARCIE is doing some of it for\\nN effect.  BRENDA brings up the rear.  They are all dressed more\\nN or less for a frolic in the lake.\\nN BILL and ALICE stand in front of the Arts & Crafts cabin.  BILL\\nN is smiling, ALICE is a little bit amused.\\nC MARCIE\\nD Help me!  Save me!  The frog people are\\nD after me!  It's swim time at Camp Crystal\\nN Lake.  Come on, Alice, I need protection!\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 44    EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - DAY\\nN A LONG WIDE SHOT reveals the cool, clear lake during the lull\\nN of a hot afternoon.\\nN At the edge of the lake, in the shallows, are the members of\\nN the group:  MARCIE, JACK, NED, BRENDA, BILL and ALICE.  They\\nN are sitting or paddling or diving off the float.  There is no\\nN real attempt to exert too much energy.\\nN Gradually we become aware that this LONG WIDE SHOT is someone's\\nN POV.  The CAMERA moves from its stable position, now hand-held,\\nN on a trajectory around the side of the lake, out of sight.\\nN Branches, brush, and twigs are butted through.  Occasionally,\\nN we can see part of the PROWLER's arm fending off the underbrush.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 45    EXT.

He looks with googly eyes at ALICE.\\nC NED\\nD There are sand sharks in this lake and\\nD they can eat the bathing suit right off\\nD you.\\nN ALICE laughs.\\nC NED\\nE (continuing)\\nD See?  I'm getting to you.  Very slowly.\\nN NED does a porpoise drive and disappears.\\nN BRENDA is not laughing.  She is looking off towards the cabin\\nN area.\\nN ALICE sees her and look where she looks.\\nC ALICE\\nN What'd you see?\\nC BRENDA\\nD I don't know.  Marcie's got me paranoid.\\nN She smiles.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 48    EXT. BEHIND ALICE'S CABIN - DAY\\nN The CAMERA, shooting from the PROWLER's POV, moves to a place\\nN alongside Alice's cabin.  There is underbrush about two feet\\nN tall and all around that area.  The PROWLER stops, leans down\\nN and reaches into FRAME with a gloved hand.\\nN The gloved hand reaches into the underbrush for the tip of a\\nN burlap bag which has been secreted there.  The hand lifts the\\nN bag, which has something in it that moves.\\nN The CAMERA MOVES around to the side of the cabin right below\\nN the window.  The window is open, making entry quite simple.\\nN The PROWLER's gloved hands untie the neck of the bag, reach in\\nN and haul out quickly a medium-sized snake.  One hand has the\\nN animal firmly behind the jaws.  The hand takes the snake and\\nN puts it through the open window, leaving it on the clean white\\nN coverlet.  It slithers across the bed.\\nN The PROWLER's hand closes the window.\\nN The CAMERA MOVES towards one of the sheds.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 49    EXT. EDGE OF LAKE - DAY\\nN BILL and ALICE are lying on the shore on their towels, watching\\nN the OTHERS in the water and grabbing some afternoon sun.  ALICE\\nN is on her stomach, tracing angular designs in the sand.  BILL\\nN is on his back, listening.\\nC BILL\\nD It still hurts?\\nC ALICE\\nD I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt,\\nD but I thought I could stand anything.\\nE (pause)\\nD I just wasn't ready for that kind of\\nD pain.  We were supposed to meet in L.A.\\nD When I got back there, he sent a telegram\\nD saying he was going back to his wife.\\nN BILL turns over so he can look at her better.\\nC BILL\\nD What'll you do when you leave here?\\nC ALICE\\nD I don't know.\\nN Various feet enter the FRAME.  BILL and ALICE look up to see\\nN JACK with his arm around MARCIE, NED toweling his head, and\\nN BRENDA putting on her blue workshirt.\\nC MARCIE\\nD Pistachio, fudge ripple, creme de menthe\\nD and I are going back to work.\\nN BILL gets up.\\nC BILL\\nD Speaking as black raspberry, I guess I'm\\nD ready.  Frozen yogurt?\\nN ALICE smiles at the reference.\\nC ALICE\\nD I'll be along.\\nC NED\\nE (in a nelly voice)\\nD Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll\\nD scratch your eyes out...\\nN They head off.  ALICE turns over to tan her front.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 50    EXT. FOREST - DAY\\nN A machete rips through some vines.  Again it hacks at the brush.\\nN PULLS BACK to reveal BILL clearing away the years of vine\\nN growth which have choked off a path.  He wipes the perspiration\\nN from his eyes and continues along.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 51    EXT. BEHIND THE MAIN CABIN - DAY\\nN Set up behind the cabin is a make-shift exercise area.  There\\nN are chinning bars--pipeslashed between two trees--and there's\\nN an aging set of parallel bars.  There is even a set of weights\\nN made from tin cans, pipes and assorted amount of cement.\\nN ECU of NEDS's face in a distorted, twisted expression.  He\\nN explodes his breath.\\nN We PULL BACK to see BRENDA watching NED work out on the uneven\\nN parallel bars.  He is really very good and there is no doubt\\nN about his strength.\\nC BRENDA\\nD Not bad.\\nN As NED moves off the apparatus, BRENDA comes in and does a neat\\nN little turn which is dazzling.  NED does a take.\\nC NED\\nD Holy shit...\\nC BRENDA\\nD We wouldn't want you thinking you're the\\nD only show-off in camp, would we?\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 52    EXT. LAKE - DAY\\nN The sun has dropped lower on the horizon.\\nN The CAMERA looks down on ALICE as she sleeps peacefully in the\\nN late sun.  A shadow passes across her face, and she awakes with\\nN a start.\\nN CUT BACK to see BILL standing over her with a machete.\\nC ALICE\\nN I didn't know I was asleep...What time\\nD is it?\\nC BILL\\nD Almost five.\\nN ALICE gets up.\\nC ALICE\\nD Now I'm only eleven hours behind\\nN schedule.  Steve is going to have a\\nN small cow.\\nN They walk away from the shore.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 53    EXT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY\\nN ALICE is walking quicker than BILL.  We realize we have seen\\nN this cabin before--when the snake was placed in it.\\nC BILL\\nD You can only do what you can do.\\nC ALICE\\nD And then Steve looks at you with those\\nD hurt eyes--like you don't care about\\nD children...\\nN BILL laughs at her imitation.\\nC ALICE\\nE (continuing)\\nD I'll see you later.\\nN She turns to go up the steps to her front door.\\nC BILL\\nD Alice?\\nN She stops and look down at him.  He is serious and he cares.\\nN ALICE appreciates what's she's just heard.  She knows that it\\nN wasn't easy for BILL to say.\\nC ALICE\\nD You're very nice.\\nN They share a short silent moment.\\nC BILL\\nD Hope you will.\\nN BILL smiles and turns and jogs off, still carrying his long\\nN blade.\\nN ALICE watches him go.  She shrugs.  This might be a good place\\nN to stay.  She turns and goes into her cabin.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 54    INT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY\\nN In the FG is the camp bed with its white coverlet.  The snake\\nN is nowhere in sight--which means it could be anywhere.\\nN ALICE is humming to herself and is happier now than she has\\nN been since we met her.\\nN The room is small.  There is the metal-frame cot, an old wooden\\nN dresser with a cloudy mirror on top.  The walls are a light\\nN blue, freshly painted.  The wall on the inside does not go all\\nN the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on\\nN in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side.\\nN ALICE looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what\\nN she sees.  She pushes her hair so that she looks a little\\nN sexier.  She smiles at herself.\\nN She reaches out in CU.  Open a drawer.  Takes out a towel.\\nN ALICE turns and goes to her footlocker.  Bends down and opens\\nN it up.  Takes out a terrycloth robe.\\nN She closes the footlocker, stands up and heads out the door.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 55    EXT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY\\nN ALICE heads from her cabin to the showers.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 56    INT. SHOWER ROOM - DAY\\nN ALICE walks into her room wearing her bathrobe, her hair in a\\nN towel-turban.  She flicks off her shower clogs, and looks for\\nN her hairbrush.  She takes her towel off and lets her tangled\\nN hair fall down.\\nN She hums.  Opens her top drawer.  Nothing there.\\nN Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there.\\nN Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there.\\nN ALICE opens the fourth drawer and the snake strikes!  It flails\\nN at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier\\nN as having a Navajo bracelet on it.  The snake strikes the\\nN bracelet, hangs on as ALICE tries to shake it free.  The snake\\nN falls to the floor and recoils for another attack.\\nN There is no way that ALICE can get past the snake to run away.\\nN Her scream is loud.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 57    EXT. MAIN CABIN - DAY\\nN BILL, returning from his last half hour of trail-blazing, hears\\nN ALICE.\\nS ALICE (O.S.)\\nD Help!\\nN BILL doesn't hesitate.  Carrying his machete, he runs to\\nN ALICE's cabin.\\nN MARCIE and JACK follow in the BG.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 58    INT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY\\nN ALICE is backed against the wall.  The snake could strike and\\nN get her.\\nN BILL runs into the room, still carrying his machete.  He looks\\nN at ALICE.\\nC ALICE\\nE (a tight whisper)\\nD There's a fucking snake in here.\\nN BILL sees it.  He freezes, then takes a step forward.\\nN Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the\\nN machete, cutting the snake into two pieces.  Blood spurts onto\\nS the floor.\\nN MARCIE and JACK enter.  JACK carries a shovel as a weapon.\\nN MARCIE stops when she sees the embrace, but then looks further\\nN to see the blood and guts.\\nC MARCIE\\nD Steve never mentioned serpents.  Jack,\\nD would you get some paper towels?\\nN JACK nods and exits.\\nC ALICE\\nN How the... did he get in there?\\nC BILL\\nD Slipped in.  Probably liked the scent of\\nD your perfume.\\nN JACK return and tosses a roll to MARCIE.\\nC MARCIE\\nO Thanks.\\nC BILL\\nD You okay now?\\nN ALICE nods.\\nN BILL gives her an extra hug.  Then steps back awkwardly,\\nN stepping on MARCIE's big toe.\\nC MARCIE\\nD Go ahead.  I walk on 'em all the time.\\nE (to JACK)\\nD Would you shovel Mr. Snake outta here?\\nN JACK nods.  He picks up his shovel and we see in CU as he gets\\nN underneath the wide-fanged snake.\\nN MARCIE begins to clean the blood off the floor with the paper\\nN toweling.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 59    EXT. CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON\\nN Looking across the lake, we can see the camp, nestled in among\\nN the late afternoon rays of the sun.  We can hear the sounds of\\nN the nocturnal animals beginning to rise and hunt.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 60    INT. CAMP KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON\\nN The kitchen and the main meeting room are really one in the\\nN same room, cut off by a partition.  The kitchen has a couple of\\nN sinks, a heavy old stove, long shelves, a pantry/larder, and\\nN some windows which look out on the rear.\\nN BRENDA is making a salad for herself.  She is a vegetarian.\\nN MARCIE is making a guacamole dip.\\nN In the big room there is a fireplace and a ping pong table.\\nN JACK and BILL are playing.\\nC BRENDA                        JACK\\nD She all right?                Get ready for the schneider.\\nC MARCIE                        BILL\\nD Yeah.  Scared the hell out    No chance.\\nD of her.\\nC JACK\\nD BRENDA                Four zip.\\nN How'd it get in the drawer?\\nN ALICE walks into the kitchen.  She has washed her face after\\nN getting her act together.  She stands in the doorway to the\\nN kitchen.\\nC MARCIE\\nD How you doin'?\\nC ALICE\\nD Okay.  Can I help?\\nC BRENDA\\nD It's catch as catch can.  I'm making a\\nN salad.  The guys are planning to cook\\nD greaseburgers for themselves.\\nC MARCIE\\nD There's a lot of dishes if you just want\\nD something to do.\\nN ALICE smiles.  Nods.\\nC ALICE\\nN The way I feel, that's perfect.\\nN ALICE goes to the sink and begins to work her way through the\\nN dirty dish pan.\\nN NED comes flying through the door dressed in various bits and\\nN pieces of old Indian costumery.  He does a bad dance.\\nN JACK and BILL quit their game and come to the doorway.\\nC JACK                          BILL\\nN What the hell?                Where'd you get that stuff?\\nC MARCIE                        BRENDA\\nD Oh, Lord!                     Neddy!\\nC JACK\\nD It's gonna be a long summer.\\nC NED\\nD Wait, wait!   When I was finding these\\nD goodies in the shed.  I also found this\\nD letter which a camper never sent home.\\nD Listen.\\nN He takes a letter out of his breechclout.  He pretends to read,\\nN when really we can see that the paper is blank.\\nC NED\\nE (improvising)\\nD Dear Mom and Dad, Camp Blood is real fine\\nD except for the strange man who flies at\\nD night and sucks our counsellor's body...\\nN ALICE leans against the sink and laughs.  She is a very pretty\\nN girl, younger than she first appeared.\\nC NED\\nE (continuing)\\nD And, Mommy, we really love our counsellor.\\nD He says that whenever I'm scared, I can\\nD sleep in his bunk with him.\\nN JACK and BILL laugh.\\nN NED takes off his headdress.\\nC NED\\nE (continuing)\\nD No wonder they lost America.  How could\\nD you sneak around in the bushes wearing\\nD that?  What's to eat?\\nC BRENDA\\nD Whatever you make yourself.\\nN ALICE looks up from her dishes and cocks her head to the side.\\nN Does she sees something?\\nN The CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to look over her shoulder.\\nN The window pane is dirty and it's a bit difficult to see, but\\nN there is something standing there out by a cabin.  But it\\nN stands, doesn't move... Is it a building?\\nN CUT AWAY to see ALICE using her dishcloth to clear the glass.\\nN When we CUT BACK, the shape is gone.\\nN REACTION SHOT:  ALICE.  Curious.  A cold chill...\\nN ALICE looks around at the others who are still adlibbing about\\nN food.\\nC BRENDA                        JACK\\nD How can you eat that stuff?   You like them rare?\\nN Looks like dead animals.\\nC BILL\\nD NED                   Too bad that Annie never\\nD Cannibals.  It's old          showed.  She was supposed\\nD counsellor.                   to be a good cook.\\nC BRENDA                        MARCIE\\nD You can get all the protein   No way I am gonna play chef\\nD you need if you mix them      to all of you guys.

Pulls the light cord in the middle of the room.\\nN The bulb does not light.\\nN ALICE pulls it again.\\nC BILL\\nD Trouble?\\nC ALICE\\nD Bad bulb or no power.  It's getting a\\nD little gloomy in here.\\nC JACK\\nD Steve taught me how to use the emergency\\nD generator.  The town power lines are\\nD supposed to be real shitty.\\nC NED\\nD God, but I love that macho talk!\\nD Emergency generators!  The Indian used\\nD campfires.\\nN JACK turns to BILL.\\nC JACK\\nD Give me a hand?\\nC BILL\\nD For sure.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 61    INT. GENERATOR SHED - LATE AFTERNOON\\nN JACK steps in and, in CU, we see there is a puddle where he is\\nN standing.  The puddle is somehow significant.\\nN BILL leans over JACK's shoulder to see what he's doing.\\nC BILL\\nN This is almost like the one at my\\nN uncle's cabin in Maine.\\nC JACK\\nD Here we go.\\nN The CAMERA watches JACK's actions tightly.  In a REVERSE POV we\\nN see JACK's tongue come out the side of his mouth as he\\nN concentrates.  He bites down on it.\\nN ANOTHER ANGLE:  as JACK pulls the starter cord.  The engine\\nN roars into action.\\nC JACK\\nE (yelling)\\nD Now ya' close the switch.\\nN CU as JACK's hand reaches in and touches a heavy-duty metal\\nN switch.  A spark arcs and we PULL BACK to see JACK with a\\nN perfect connection running through his body.  There is a\\nN sparking sound, the little light in the shed blinks, JACK\\nN screams, the generator chugs roughly.  Hundreds of volts are\\nN streaking through JACK's body and grounded through his wet\\nN shoes.\\nN BILL reacts quickly:  knowing better than to touch him and\\nN continue the connection, he takes a half-step backwards, aims\\nN at an oblique angle and executes a perfect Bruce Lee-type drop-\\nN kick on his friend, severing the contact.\\nN JACK stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead.  The\\nN machine stops.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 62    EXT. GENERATOR SHED - LATE AFTERNOON\\nN JACK lands, almost unconscious.  BILL kneels into FRAME and\\nN cheeks JACK's vital sign:  his eyes, his carotid pulse, his\\nN breathing.\\nN JACK shakes his head.\\nC JACK\\nD I'll be okay.  Holy shit...\\nC BILL\\nD Don't get up.  Take a second...\\nN JACK lies back down.  Covers his eyes with his arm.\\nC JACK\\nD You saved my life.\\nC BILL\\nD I had to.\\nC JACK\\nO Thanks.\\nC BILL\\nD I figured if I didn't save you.  I'd\\nD have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that\\nD would have ruined my appetite.\\nN JACKS looks up and smiles.  BILL give him a hand and the groggy\\nN athlete gets to his feet.\\nC JACK\\nD Whew.\\nN Satisfied that JACK won't fall down, BILL goes to the shed and\\nN looks in.\\nN We can look in over BILL's shoulder and see a smoke-scarred\\nN switch and a now-silent generator.\\nC BILL\\nD This puddle was enough to ground you all\\nD the way to China.\\nN JACK looks in, too.\\nC JACK\\nN Floor probably leaks.  This area is full\\nN of springs.\\nC BILL\\nD A short somewhere.\\nN BILL leans down and sees a smokey-colored wire that touches\\nN another wire.\\nC BILL\\nE (continuing)\\nD There's the problem, Jack.  Wire worked\\nD itself loose.\\nN He starts to wind it round a set-screw in CU.\\nC JACK\\nD Just in cause this bugger goes bad.

Right!\\nN MARCIE is finishing up making her green California dip.\\nN Suddenly ALICE cries out.

The door\\nN doesn't budge.\\nN REACTION SHOT:  ALICE decides to pull harder.\\nN She puts down her lamp and uses both hands and tugs.  She pulls\\nN until she finally wrenches the door open.  The lamp casts long\\nN shadows upwards.\\nN The generator sits silent.\\nN ALICE leans into the shed to look.\\nN The CAMERA TRACKS very slowly around behind her so that we can\\nN see behind the right-hand corner of the building.  As we clear\\nN the edge, we see something hanging from a rope which runs down\\nN from a branch above.\\nN The something turns slowly in the wind.  It is BILL--dead--in\\nN a travesty of the martyrdom of St. Sebastian, shot with arrows.\\nN ALICE comes out of the shed, distraught.\\nN ALICE\\nN Bill?\\nN She closes the door, and turns in the direction of the body.\\nN REACTION SHOT:  ALICE.  She is riveted with horror, unable to\\nN move or turn or run.

Nothing under the\\nN couch.\\nN ALICE gets back up and rushes to the ping-pong table to get the\\nN lamp.\\nN Just as she reaches the table--which is more or less against a\\nN window--a figure swings, pendulum-like, into the glass,\\nN shattering the pane in the window opposite ALICE.\\nN It is BRENDA, long-since dead, dripping wet, white-faced.\\nN ALICE sees her, turns and runs as fast as she can for the front\\nN door.\\nN ALICE flings open the wooden door and runs into a rain-suited\\nN figure.\\nN ALICE screams.  The figure holds ALICE in a strong grasp.\\nN When ALICE focuses, she sees a kindly woman in her early\\nN forties.  She is strong, fairly tall, and very nice-looking.\\nN This is MRS. VOORHEES.  She wants ALICE to stop shrieking long\\nN enough to tell her what the matter is.  ALICE sobs incoherently,\\nN pointing back to the rear window.\\nC MRS. VOORHEES\\nD There now, my dear.  Please.  I can't\\nD help you if you can't talk to me.\\nD There, there now...\\nN ALICE allows the woman to lead her back into the room.\\nN MRS. VOORHEES leads ALICE to the couch.

They were making love when\\nD that boy drowned.\\nN ALICE looks up as the WOMAN strokes her hair.\\nN ANOTHER ANGLE:  MCU as the OLDER WOMAN's hand strokes the\\nN YOUNGER WOMAN's hair.  The hand is missing its little finger!\\nN The THEME enters upon the TRACK in a lyrical, child-like\\nN version, echoing back to another era, pretty and light.\\nC MRS. VOORHEES\\nE (continuing)\\nD We should go now.\\nC ALICE\\nD Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.\\nN MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head gently.\\nC MRS. VOORHEES\\nD No.  That won't be necessary.\\nN As she speaks, MRS.

While her\\nN voice remains warm and comforting, her face has started to slip\\nN into her other manifestation.  All of this is in concert with\\nN the visibility of her weapon.\\nC MRS. VOORHEES\\nD It was my son they killed.  They said he\\nD drowned, but I know it was inadequate\\nD supervision...\\nN ALICE starts to become increasingly anxious.  She can't see the\\nN knife rise behind her.\\nC ALICE\\nD Mr. Christy will be back soon.\\nN MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head from side to side.\\nC MRS. VOORHEES\\nD No, he won't.  I killed him as well....\\nN The shock of recognition hits ALICE.  In CU her eyes look up\\nN and see the knife which MRS.

The THEME is going full-tilt as\\nN ALICE makes a quick turn to run towards the road.\\nN TWO-SHOT:  as ALICE bumps into an object which swings from\\nN above.  A slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of\\nN STEVE CHRISTY hanging from the tree.  A rope is looped under\\nN his arms, his head is down on his chest, and a long blade\\nN protrudes from his heart.\\nN REACTION SHOT:  ALICE in terror.\\nN ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs and suddenly bumps into another pair\\nN of legs which swing from the same big tree.\\nN STROBE SHOT:  of JACK, dead.\\nN ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs for the Arts & Crafts.

We hear the\\nN SOUNDS of the generator starting outside and suddenly three\\nN bright overhead lights come on.\\nN ALICE looks across the room to the light switch, afraid to\\nN reveal her hiding place.\\nN She looks for an escape.  There's a window.  She starts for it,\\nN then stops and turns and dives under an arts & crafts table.\\nN ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES opens the door and walks in a few\\nN feet.\\nN She carries a machete in her hand.  We see this instrument in\\nN CU as we hear OVER the sound of her son, JASON, calling to her.\\nC JASON (V.O.)\\nD Help, mommy, I'm drowning!  Oh, mommy,\\nO please....\\nN The CAMERA PANS UP to her face and we see that the voice of\\nN JASON is coming from within her in LIP SYNC.  She is both\\nN characters--though the child's voice is authentically dubbed.\\nN ALICE can just make out what is happening and can hear the\\nN VOICE OF JASON.\\nN ALICE is very still.  Her eyes widen as she listens to MRS.\\nN VOORHEES rave.\\nC JASON (Lipsync)\\nD Don't let me die, mommy... I can't\\nD breathe... Help me, breathe...\\nN MRS.

VOORHEES\\nE (in her own voice)\\nD I can't let them kill any more children.\\nD Come out now.\\nN She wades through table after table, pushing them out of her\\nN way with the strength she has demonstrated throughout as the\\nN PROWLER.\\nN When MRS. VOORHEES is too quick for her, shoving a table across\\nN her path like a barred door.  Before ALICE can think twice,\\nN MRS. VOORHEES has shoved a second table in behind her so that\\nN now ALICE is sandwiched between them.\\nN She can duck down or climb over or come out the only open end--\\nN the end where MRS. VOORHEES is standing.\\nN ALICE looks behind her and sees a shelf.  On the shelf is a box.\\nN MRS. VOORHEES is coming down the aisle between the two tables.\\nN Her machete is coming up in an attack.\\nN ALICE reaches into the box in CU and pulls out a handful of\\nN leather-working tools.  She hurls them at MRS. VOORHEES as hard\\nN as she can.\\nN MRS. VOORHEES has to put her arms up to ward off the spinning\\nN knives.  One cuts her under the eye and she lets out a low\\nN animal bellow.\\nN ALICE leaps up, climbs over the table and runs for the door.\\nN MRS. VOORHEES shoves the tables over and hurries after her.\\nN ALICE gets to the door, shuts off the light switch and runs out.\\nN We can hear JASON'S VOICE.\\nC JASON (V.O.)\\nD Kill her, mommy!

On the walls are five .22 calibre rifles.\\nN ALICE runs into the dimly lit cabin and takes one of the rifles\\nN from the wall.\\nN She rummages in a drawer.  It's empty.

A shadow covers ALICE's back.  She\\nN turns.\\nN ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES is standing in the doorway,\\nN blocking the light.  Still carrying the machete, MRS. VOORHEES\\nN steps slowly toward ALICE.\\nN ALICE, with an almost useless .22 in her hands, does the only\\nN thing she can.  She takes the weapon by the barrel and,\\nN swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks MRS. VOORHEES on the\\nN arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall.\\nN MRS.

MAIN CABIN FRONT - NIGHT\\nN ALICE huffs past the dead camper van, through the mud to the\\nN front door of the main cabin.  She runs in quickly.  There is\\nN no sign of MRS. VOORHEES.  She turns off the lights and runs\\nN into the kitchen.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 133    INT.

LARDER - NIGHT\\nN There is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices.\\nN ALICE's hands fasten onto the inside lock--the dead bolt type\\nN which requires a key to unlock it from the other side.\\nN ALICE relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside.\\nN As soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam.\\nN Then we hear some shuffling around outside.  The lights are\\nN turned on.\\nC JASON (V.O.)\\nD Please kill her, mommy... Help me,\\nD please.  Kill her, mommy.\\nN There is the sound of pots being rustled through.  Then the\\nN sound of another door being slammed.\\nN ALICE relaxes again.\\nN Then there is a silence.  ALICE thinks about unlocking the door\\nN now.  She reaches out for the lock.  Then thinks better of the\\nN idea.\\nN She cases down the door frame to the floor.  On all sides are\\nN the cans of food and cooking implements.  There is a large\\nN skillet, some bags of flour, etc.\\nN ALICE covers her head with her arms.\\nN The doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very\\nN slowly.  We see it, but she does not.  MRS. VOORHEES' hand\\nN finishes turning and now starts to push gently.  There is\\nN almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested.\\nN The voice on the other side is very young, very sing-song.\\nC JASON (O.S.)\\nN Come out, come out, wherever you are...\\nN ALICE jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small\\nN room.\\nN Fists bang in a rage on the floor.\\nN ALICE\\nO Please...\\nN ALICE folds her hands at the side of her face.\\nN The fist-banging gives way to a short silence.\\nN The silence is interrupted by a new sound:  MRS. VOORHEES has\\nN begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the\\nS door to the larder.\\nN REACTION SHOT:  ALICE... oh, my God...\\nN At first we see nothing on our side.  Then, gradually, we see\\nN little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops.  ALICE's\\nN eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense,\\nN anything...\\nN Larger holes are now made.  MRS. VOORHEES stops just long enough\\nN to take a peck inside.  We can see her eye at the largest hole.\\nN She goes back to whacking away at the door.  The hole is near\\nN the lock.  It is soon big enough for MRS. VOORHEES to reach\\nN inside with her hand and turn the rachet.\\nN ALICE realizes she must defend herself.  She reaches down and\\nN picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, ALICE raises\\nN her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to\\nN come through the entrance.\\nN MRS. VOORHEES chops down with the machete.  ALICE fends off the\\nN blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her\\nN head.  As the machete blade bounces off the skillet, ALICE is\\nN able to swing the skillet downward and hit MRS. VOORHEES with\\nN a solid blow on top of her head.  MRS. VOORHEES sprawls\\nN sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the\\nN floor.\\nN ALICE raises the skillet again to strike.  She crosses\\nN carefully to MRS. VOORHEES and pushes her gently with her foot,\\nN the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway.\\nN ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert.  There is a\\nN small puddle of blood under her head.\\nN ANGLE ON ALICE:  She relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses\\nN slowly out of the room.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 135    EXT.

The birds are\\nN up, foraging for food.\\nN As the CAMERA scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky\\nN reflected in the calm waters of Crystal Lake.  The canoe\\nN holding ALICE is drifting in big slow circles across the\\nN surface of the lake.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 138    EXT. LAKE - DAWN\\nN ALICE lies, in MCU, in the canoe, sleeping.  She has not\\nN changed her position since collapsing a few hours before.  The\\nN water laps gently against the side of the canoe.  Very slowly,\\nN she wakes.  She opens her eyes.\\nN The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree\\nN boughs that overhang the edge of the lake.\\nN They shade ALICE from the bright rays of the sun.  The canoe\\nN rocks gently.  ALICE is still, listening to the sound of the\\nN lapping water.\\nN Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a MUSICAL STINGER,\\nN and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of MRS.\\nN VOORHEES, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe,\\nN barely missing ALICE's slumped form!\\nN The canoe immediately overturns and both MRS. VOORHEES and ALICE\\nN try to find their footing in the shallow water.  MRS. VOORHEES\\nN is covered in mud and blood.  She sees ALICE struggling to get\\nN up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete.\\nN ALICE turns, sees MRS. VOORHEES coming.  ALICE grabs a paddle\\nN floating near her.\\nN MRS. VOORHEES pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the\\nN waist-high water as fast as she can.  She screams with rage.\\nN Her face goes through a horrifying transformation.  From her\\nN mouth comes the VOICE OF JASON.\\nS JASON (Lipsync)\\nD Mommy!  Mommy!  Mommy!\\nN ALICE can't move fast enough to get away from MRS. VOORHEES,\\nN who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit ALICE.\\nN ALICE slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has\\nN to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle,\\nN using it like a staff to ward off the blow.  The machete cuts\\nN the paddle nearly in half.  MRS. VOORHEES raises the knife for\\nN another blow and ALICE lunges for her knees and succeeds in\\nN throwing MRS. VOORHEES into the water.  The machete flies out\\nN of her hand and lands in the water.  The two women roll in the\\nN water.  MRS. VOORHEES is trying to strangle ALICE, her hands\\nN stretching to reach around her throat.  They roll over and\\nN under the water.  We cannot see who is winning.\\nN Suddenly MRS. VOORHEES finds her footing and stands up, looking\\nN for ALICE.  She is screeching madly.\\nC JASON (Lipsync)\\nE (continuing)\\nD Kill her, mommy!  Kill her, mommy!\\nN ALICE shoots up out of the water holding the machete, and in\\nN one, wild swing, decapitates MRS.

There\\nN is an awful moment, as the second car blares on the horn.\\nN Traffic continues, but the lingering feeling of dread and\\nN confusion is still in the air.\\nC BRIAN\\nD Fuck!\\nC DAVID\\nE (annoyed)\\nD We almost died.\\nO 8\\nC BRIAN\\nD I know.

On second\\nN glance, she's a killer. He notes her oddly funny behavior.\\nN She removes the coat to reveal a very simple natural\\nN beauty. She is SOFIA SERRANO, a 27 year-old city girl with\\nN a barely containable life-force. Enter PETER BROWN,\\nN David's male assistant with surreptitious headset.

Each word bashes\\nN his soul.\\nC TIPP\\nD -- your job. Your life. Your\\nD position. They are working day\\nD and night. to cheat you out of your\\nD 51% vote. And they are going to\\nD sell this tradition, this\\nD tradition of words, so they can\\nD eat at a better cafeteria. And\\nD what they don't know is this -\\nE (gestures grandly to\\nE books that surround\\nE them)\\nD - people will read again.\\nN David's gaze falls upon Sofia, who is looking directly at\\nN him.

He feels saved.\\nC DAVID\\nE (interrupting with\\nE finality)\\nD I got it.\\nC TIPP\\nD They even have a nickname for you\\nD behind your back.\\nN David smiles faintly. Understandingly.   Tipp kisses him\\nN on the cheek, boldly and drunkenly. He feels like a hero\\nN to himself.\\nC TIPP\\nD Citizen Dildo.\\nN David flinches, just a little.\\nC TIPP\\nD Now you've got great instincts.\\nD But I say this with complete love.\\nD Claim your life...

APARTMENT - NIGHT\\nN She switches the light on in an artfully messy city girl\\nN apartment. A life is lived here, a bed on the back-room\\nN floor, a bag of trash on the counter, lamp is askew.

He soaks in the details,\\nN including some miniature dolls that occupy her kitchen and\\nN shelves.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Hey Paulo!\\nN A large goofy dog comes running at her, and then proceeds\\nN to slather David with love too.\\nC DAVID\\nD I'm glad he protects you.

A young girl living a young\\nN girl's hard-working and happy life. Group photos of co-\\nN workers. A few from a vacation. A whole new cast of\\nN characters, all committed, and they all look inviting to\\nN him. And one gloriously random photo of her in Cabo San\\nN Lucas, raising a toast with friends.\\nC DAVID\\nD I like your life.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Well, it's mine and you can't have\\nD it.\\nN David examines a humorously embarrassing vacation photo of\\nN a sloshed Sofia, a guy's arm reaching for her breast.\\nN Dedication reads: To Sergio!

Okay - done.\\nN Sofia offers her drawing. It's a caricature of a good-\\nN looking guy surrounded by money, cars and very thin girls.\\nN He snatches it, studies it, and what he sees hurts him in\\nN surprising ways.\\nC DAVID\\nE (embarrassed laugh)\\nD Jesus. That's how you see me?\\nC SOFIA\\nD Maybe I didn't add enough money --\\nC DAVID\\nD No. It's wonderful. It's\\nD something you'd see on the wall of\\nD a steak-house in hell, but it's\\nD wonderful. Sign it.\\nN Sofia's face falls a bit. She sees she's hurt him. She\\nN takes the drawing and signs it, a little guilty.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Let's see yours.\\nC DAVID\\nD No.\\nN She grabs it. Its a rich portrait, filled with detail,\\nN humor and style.

So the longer I\\nD stay, the better it is for his\\nD career.\\nN Sofia smiles, shakes her head. And yawns.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Your career is one I'd worry\\nD about.\\nN David looks down. She's hit a nerve.\\nC SOFIA\\nD I'm sorry -\\nC DAVID\\nD No, no. You're more right then\\nD you even know.

David\\nN gently strokes her hair.    Television in b.g. It's one of\\nN those late-night infomercials, and it's ridiculously\\nN compelling. The perfect thing to bond over on a great,\\nN lingering date.\\nC INTERVIEWER ON T.V.\\nD And to those who think that you're\\nD a charlatan?\\nC OLDER MAN ON T.V.\\nD I understand. The perception of a\\nN head frozen somewhere waiting for\\nN reanimation - it sounds like\\nN science fiction.\\nC SOFIA\\nD What are you watching?\\nC DAVID\\nD It's the greatest show... it's\\nD called \\\"Sofia.\\\"\\nN Sofia looks at him and smiles. They look back to the\\nN television.\\nN ON TV INFOMERCIAL\\nN A charming looking older-man discusses eternal life with a\\nN television interviewer.\\nO 37\\nC SOFIA\\nE (off t.v.)\\nD I've seen this thirty times.\\nC DAVID\\nD We did a story on this guy.

It's\\nD safe for Benny. I'm in!\\nN David moves closer to her.\\nC SOFIA\\nD We better watch out.\\nN They regard each other, and David gets up off the sofa.\\nN It's true. The promise is too great to not savor it, and\\nN walk away for now. Thrill remains in the air.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Where are you going?\\nC DAVID\\nD I left my number on your fridge.\\nN He makes a courtly bow and turns. She feels the loss of\\nN his company.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Come here, I want to tell you a\\nD secret.\\nN He pauses a moment, and turns. In this instant, a fleeting\\nN instant, it's the oddest thing. He can see their entire\\nO 38\\nN life together. He returns to her. Tentatively, she grabs\\nN a quick sweet kiss on his mouth. He stays for an extra\\nN moment, kissing just her upper lip, leaving no doubt as to\\nN the potential of their future. And then... very close she\\nN says:\\nC SOFIA\\nD I meant that to be your forehead.\\nN David stands. He looks around the small apartment.\\nC DAVID\\nD Thank you for the inspiration. I\\nD will now attempt to run my\\nD company, showing compassion for\\nD the seething throng of my partners\\nD who root quietly for me to fail.\\nN She looks at him, quite aware of his personal and business\\nN crossroads.

I have a company to run.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Pleasure delayer.\\nN He is still somewhat stunned by the evening, and the girl.\\nN He actually wants to run his company.\\nS EXT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - DAY\\nN David slips out onto the street. It's shabbier than the\\nN alluring night-time version. He'd never notice, or care...\\nN because David is a man with a brand new buzz.                The city is\\nN his. Everything good and great suddenly feels inevitable.\\nN Life feels like a great pop song. Behind him, a car with\\nN its lights still on starts and advances alongside.           Behind\\nN the wheel is Julianna Gianni.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD David Aames.\\nN David leans on his car, turns and shakes his head.\\nC DAVID\\nD Julie Gianni.

You\\nD haven't slept with her because...\\nD it's more fun when you can draw it\\nD out. Sex just isn't as good if\\nD the woman hasn't told all her\\nD friends she'd never sleep with\\nD you.\\nC DAVID\\nD You're right on the money, Julie.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD She must be exhausted from trying\\nD to be witty for you all night\\nD long.\\nC DAVID\\nD Hey, Julie.\\nC JUL IANNA\\nD Sorry.

I missed\\nD an audition and I just felt bad\\nC 40\\nD you didn't invite me to your\\nO party.\\nN It zings him. David turns, considers her.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD Do you want to make it up to me?\\nD I won't tell a soul.\\nN Slowly, he is drawn to her. His old self rallies one last\\nN time. He gets in the car.\\nS INT. JULIANNA'S CAR -- EARLY MORNING\\nN The streets are empty.

I didn't\\nD say that.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD When did you stop caring?\\nC DAVID\\nE (watching the road)\\nD About what --\\nC JULIANNA\\nD About the consequences of the\\nD promises you made.\\nC DAVID\\nD Promises         - I thought we had an\\nD understanding.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD Do you know how hard it is to\\nD pretend to be your \\\"buddy?\\\" I\\nD love you, David. You fucked me\\nD four times in one night. You have\\nD been inside me and I have\\nD swallowed your come. That means\\nD something.\\nC DAVID\\nD Julie...\\nC JULIANNA\\nD Four times, David! That means\\nD something. Four times.\\nN He grabs at the wheel.

This music continues.\\nT TO BLACK\\nS EXT. CENTRAL PARK - HALL OF TREES - DAY - DREAM\\nN David walks the hall of trees.

She stops,\\nN sees someone she knows. A truck with several panes of\\nN glass passes by and stops in traffic. Her image blurs\\nN behind the glass, but visible to us in the window is David\\nN Acmes. His healing face is dotted with stubble. He wears\\nN a wool hat. He looks noble, an assembled victim, a modern\\nN miracle. He looks like many things. But he no longer\\nN looks like David Aames. The truck moves through frame.\\nS INT. HOSPITAL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\\nN A dashing-looking surgeon dripping with confidence, DR.\\nN POMERANZ, talks with David.\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nD The cranial structure was based on\\nD thirty pins fastened by small\\nD panels and bits of bone from the\\nD mandible... and it seems the\\nD cartilage grafts have maintained\\nD your cheek structure.\\nD Unfortunately, because you were in\\nD a coma, immediate plastic surgery\\nD was impossible.\\nC DAVID  (V.0.)\\nD Doctors. Their power is in\\nD jargon. So you study up...\\nC DAVID\\nD Is that the procedure for all\\nD Bilateral Periorbital Hematomas in\\nD a LeFort III fracture of a\\nD comatose patient?\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nE (pleasantly surprised)\\nD In a LeFort III   - absolutely. The\\nD potential for sub-cranial brain\\nD damage was too great.\\nC DAVID  (V.0.)\\nD . you do your best.\\nN David consults a list he's made.\\nC DAVID\\nD And beyond the cheek grafts, Dr.\\nD Pomeranz is, are the pins fastened\\nO 48\\nC with any kind of aluminum which\\nD could ionize and cause that\\nD pressure in my head? Because I'm\\nD ready for another operation.\\nM ANGLE SHIFTS TO REVEAL\\nN three other doctors in the room listening.\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nD Yes, we are working on processes.\\nD But it... you're specifically not\\nD at the stage where we can\\nD experiment --\\nC DAVID\\nD Experiment. Use me.\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nD The headaches will go away -\\nC DAVID\\nD These are more than headaches.\\nD This is like a steel plate slicing\\nD through my every thought.\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nD We're not cowboys. We can't, just\\nD wing it.\\nC DAVID\\nD Because I can't think straight\\nD most of the time.\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nD We can increase your medication.\\nC DAVID\\nD Yes. Medication.\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nD And there are things we'll\\nD continue to investigate. But\\nD there are so many others who've\\nD not been able to benefit\\nD aesthetically from plastic surgery\\nD as you have --\\nC DAVID\\nD This isn't about vanity, Dr.\\nC Pomeranz!\\nE (keeping rage bottled)\\nD This isn't about vanity. This is\\nD about functioning in the world.\\nC 49\\nD It is my job to be out there\\nD functioning. I've got the money,\\nD and I'll pay any amount. Invent\\nD something. Play jazz. You say\\nD you're the best face man in New\\nD York City. Fucking prove it.\\nC OTHER DOCTOR\\nD We could do something about your\\nD arm --\\nC DAVID\\nD Fuck my arm!\\nN Dr. Pomeranz looks over to a young assistant.\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nD Nobody here takes your feelings\\nD for granted. We did prepare\\nD something for you, based on the\\nD preliminary examination.\\nC DAVID\\nD Tell me. Bring it on.\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nD It's sometimes useful in the early\\nD stages of rejection. It's a\\nD facial prosthetic. It was two\\nD weeks in the making.\\nN The assistant opens a black-leather bound box. In it is\\nN the mask - molded from David's own face, locked into a\\nN pleasant, bland expression.\\nC DAVID\\nD A facial prosthetic.\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nD The aesthetic replacement does\\nD work. Emotionally, and actually.\\nC OTHER DOCTOR\\nE (helpfully)\\nD And the plastic in the aesthetic\\nD shield also filters out abusive\\nD rays, and assists in the\\nD regeneration of cells.\\nC DAVID\\nD So it's an aesthetic regenerative\\nD shield.\\nO 50\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nD That's correct. Exactly.\\nC THIRD DOCTOR\\nD And the ergonomics of the plate-\\nD barrier allows it to reflexively\\nN interact with the movements of\\nN your own face.\\nC DAVID\\nD I see --\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nD It's a helpful unit.\\nC DAVID\\nD Good. Because for a minute there\\nD I thought we were talking about a\\nD fucking mask!\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nE (beat)\\nD It's only a mask if you treat it\\nD that way.\\nC DAVID\\nD No it's great. This completely\\nD takes care of Halloween. But what\\nD about the other 364         days of the\\nO year?\\nT DISSOLVE TO\\nS EXT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY BUILDING - NIGHT\\nN Families lined up watching the ritual blowing up of the\\nN balloons the night before Thanksgiving.

DAVID'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM -- DAY\\nN David by the window of his darkened apartment. The Macy's\\nN Thanksgiving Day Parade passes just outside his window.\\nN The top of Homer Simpson's head floats by. We are a world\\nN away from the lively apartment that once hosted his\\nN swinging birthday party.\\nO 51\\nC DAVID   (V.0.)\\nD I planned my re-emergence like the\\nD Normandy Invasion.\\nN Take-out boxes, catalog orders with new clothes, comic\\nN books and magazines with ripped-out pages fill the living\\nS room.\\nS INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY\\nN A memo is placed on the floor of David's living room. Shot\\nN pulls back to see he has covered the entire floor of his\\nS living room with memos and paperwork from Aames Publishing.\\nN He stands regarding all of this information, stooped and\\nN wearing his bathrobe.\\nT INTERCUT\\nS INT.

Disheveled, in underwear, he\\nN eats red--vine licorice and M&Ms.\\nC DAVID (V.0.)\\nD I attended the monthly board\\nD meeting of the Seven Dwarves by\\nD video hook-up. Oh, baby. This\\nD was war.\\nN On screen before him, all seven, and Thomas Tipp too. Shot\\nN moves in on screen. We can feel the cool tension of their\\nN imminent takeover. David twitches, feels it physically.\\nC DAVID\\nD because nobody's buying books\\nD let's invest... my father was\\nD an adventurer.\\nO 52\\nN David sits in the middle of his office. Push in on the\\nN white tape that covers the camera on the top of the\\nN monitors.\\nC INTERCUT\\nS INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\\nN David continues practicing aloud.\\nC DAVID\\nD Sofiaaaaaaaaaaa. Serrano.\\nC DAVID   (V.0.)\\nD I grew stronger in ways I had\\nD never known before. And on\\nD December 5th... my planes filled\\nS the sky... the return of David\\nS Aames, Jr. Citizen Dildo.\\nS INT. DANCE STUDIO - DAY\\nN Sofia dances at the end of a long day. A few others leave\\nN for the day, trying not to stare at David. Sofia is there\\nN alone. For a moment, we share her solitude. She practices\\nN ballet, twisting and turning and landing in frame, looking\\nN just past camera. She freezes. She catches sight of\\nN David, undisguised. And she begins dancing again. Harder.\\nN Does she even recognize him? He moves closer, attempting\\nN an easy-going persona. We hear nothing but the sound of\\nN his heart pounding, in odd counter-rhythm to her dancing.\\nN Finally she stops.\\nC DAVID\\nD You won't believe this... but this\\nD is me smiling.\\nN She laughs a little at his strange new humor, keeps a brave\\nN front.\\nC SOFIA\\nD It's been a long time. I tried to\\nD see you but your people wouldn't\\nD let me.\\nC DAVID\\nD I didn't want to see me, okay.\\nD But then I woke up today and\\nD finally, a good hair day.\\nN David fights anxiety, smoothes his coat.\\nO 53\\nC DAVID\\nD You want to go out, you want to do\\nD something?\\nC SOFIA\\nE (convincing herself)\\nD Sure.\\nC DAVID\\nD What?\\nC SOFIA\\nD Let's go out and do something.\\nC DAVID\\nD This weekend. I'll cancel an\\nD operation or two. We'll have fun.\\nD Because I am all about fun.\\nN She kisses his cheek, pulls back quickly, and as she\\nN exits... he sees her fighting tears.\\nS INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT\\nN David's mirror is restored. He studies himself. Raises\\nN his arm higher than he has been able to. In the next room\\nN we hear Conan O'Brien welcoming:\\nC CONAN (O.S.)\\nD . please welcome, Benny the Dog.\\nS INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\\nN David watches Conan. The Owner of Benny sits with Benny\\nN himself. He wears a t-shirt reading: L.E. Benny is not\\nN the most excitable dog in town. In fact, he seems rather\\nN spacey.\\nC CONAN (O.S.)\\nD I have so many questions. To\\nD start off, tell us all just what\\nD has happened to Benny. What's\\nD Benny been through?\\nC OLDER MAN/OWNER\\nD Benny fell into the water near our\\nD home, and was frozen in the\\nD Skykomish River. And I went\\nD fishing, thinking he'd gone three\\nD months earlier', and there he was\\nD in a block of ice, and...\\nN David grabs the phone, and dials a number.\\nO 54\\nC CONAN\\nE (off the dog's\\nE complacency)\\nD He is thawed out, right?\\nN Laughter on the t.v. Riding the buzz of what he's\\nN watching, David dials.\\nC DAVID\\nD Hey listen, it's David. I'm back\\nD in your life. I saw you earlier\\nD tonight. I was just watching our\\nD old friend Benny the Dog on... on\\nD Conan... and I thought of you.\\nE (laughs)\\nD Whatever. I loved seeing you\\nD today. So I'll see you soon.\\nD You're a great dancer!\\nN He hangs up and feels instantly mortified. He looks at the\\nN phone in his hand.\\nT TO BLACK\\nS INT. CLUB - NIGHT\\nN David moves into the thick of a high-energy neighborhood\\nN dance club. He wears a facial prosthetic. In the\\nN darkness, he doesn't stick out, not much. He spots Sofia\\nN and Brian, chatting, waiting for him. The sight of the two\\nN together recalls happier times. Sofia is dressed down.\\nN Brian, on the other hand, has never looked better. His\\nN clothes are nicer. He wears them with confidence. David\\nN has practiced an opening joke, clapping his hands together.\\nN He will be trying too hard, all night long.\\nN They regard him in the mask.\\nC SOFIA\\nE (a little too big)\\nD Hi!\\nC BRIAN\\nE (equally big)\\nD Hey.\\nC DAVID\\nD What are you drinking?\\nC SOFIA\\nD Nothing.\\nO 55\\nC BRIAN\\nD I am in the mood for cheap sugary\\nD overpriced rum-and-cokes.

I\\nD mean, girl who looks like Bjork.\\nN She leaves. David turns to Brian immediately.\\nC DAVID\\nD You look good, man. How's your\\nD book?\\nC BRIAN\\nD Take it off.\\nC DAVID\\nD I can't. It's a facial shield.\\nD It's an antiseptic prosthesis to\\nD stop infections. These fucking\\nD doctors.\\nC BRIAN\\nE (with all love)\\nD Take off the mask! It's freaking\\nD me out.\\nC DAVID\\nD I can't. It's my face. This is\\nD my face.\\nC BRIAN\\nD Oh no. Trust me. It's a little\\nD different.\\nC DAVID\\nD Hey, if you're embarrassed, just\\nD go. Nobody asked you to chaperone\\nO 56\\nC BRIAN\\nD Sofia asked me.\\nC DAVID\\nD She didn't want to be alone with\\nD me?\\nE (Brian regrets his words)\\nD That's bullshit. Because I think\\nD I'm being pretty fucking cool\\nD about the whole thing.\\nC BRIAN\\nD Talk to a shrink!        Or you can\\nD call me sometime, instead of\\nD hiding in your apartment. Don't\\nD take it out on a girl you only met\\nD once.\\nC DAVID\\nE (stung)\\nD Did she say that? I met her\\nD \\\"once?\\\" Did she say I met her\\nD \\\"once?\\\"\\nN Brian looks away. He's said too much.\\nC BRIAN\\nD Cut it out. I miss the old you.\\nD We all miss the old you. Because\\nD the new guy is shit.\\nN David turns away. The perfectly wrong thing to say.\\nC BRIAN\\nD Oh. Man. Wait. That came out\\nD wrong. I love you - period.\\nD How's your arm, man?\\nN David shakes his head, moves toward the bar.\\nC DAVID\\nD Fuck you, Brian. How about no\\nD more sympathy? How about if\\nD that's the deal we make with each\\nD other? Okay?\\nN David shakes him off, goes to the bar, and rips off his\\nN mask. His head thuds from a migraine.\\nC DAVID\\nD Gimme a Budweiser and a shot of\\nD tequila.\\nO 57\\nC BARMAN\\nE (avoiding eye contact)\\nD What kind of tequila?\\nC DAVID\\nD What did you say to me?\\nC BARMAN\\nE (leans closer, still\\nE looking down)\\nD I said - What. Kind. Of.\\nD Tequila.\\nC DAVID\\nD Why don't you ask me to my face,\\nD bitch?\\nN The barman looks up, expressionless.\\nC DAVID\\nD Patron. If you have it.\\nS ON DAVID - LATER\\nN watching Sofia and Brian from a distance, talking as\\nD friends.\\nC DAVID\\nD Another shot, another Bud.\\nD He throws bills on the bar.\\nC BARMAN\\nD No. This is on the house.\\nC DAVID\\nD Why -\\nC BARMAN\\nE (odd compassion)\\nD It just is. Bitch.\\nN David looks across the club to see Sofia. A Clubgoer Guy\\nN whispers something in her ear. She shakes it off. He\\nN pounds down another shot at the bar, this time with the\\nN Barman.\\nC DAVID\\nD Patron!\\nN David regards a video monitor behind the bar. Someone's\\nN camera is fixed on Sofia dancing with Brian, and another\\nN good-looking Young Man. She playfully shoves the good-\\nN looking Young Man away, not unlike the move that won David\\nO 58\\nN over lo those many nights ago at her apartment. He pounds\\nN back another drink.\\nS INT. CLUB BATHROOM - NIGHT\\nN Weaving at the urinal, David pees. Squeezes his temples to\\nN ward off a headache.\\nC CLUBGOER # 1\\nD Dude, fix your face!!\\nN The Clubgoers laugh. David laughs too. Suddenly, he feels\\nN better.\\nS INT. CLUB         - NIGHT\\nN David moves through the crowd, powered by a new sense of\\nN belonging. The music swirls, and takes him along with it.\\nN He dances wildly. In the strobing darkness, he is\\nN anonymous, moving with the group, lost as one. David takes\\nN the mask and pulls it over his head, backwards. In\\nN profile, his two faces stare in opposite directions. David\\nN sees his moment. Sofia is alone near the corner of the\\nN club. He approaches her.\\nC DAVID\\nD Hello again.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Hello again.\\nC DAVID\\nD Idea. Let's start all over.\\nN He regards her for a moment, sees her apprehension and\\nN discomfort.\\nC DAVID\\nD How about if you help me? Unless\\nD I'm horning in here -\\nE (beat, does her)\\nD You are. But the food is good.\\nN He continues, taking a step.\\nC DAVID\\nD See, I've got a little problem.\\nD I've got a stalker.\\nE (does her)\\nD It doesn't sound life-threatening.\\nE (does himself, self-\\nE deprecating)\\nD I need a cover. I need for you to\\nD pretend we're having a\\nO 59\\nC scintillating conversation and\\nD you're wildly entertained. I know\\nD it's tough.\\nE (does her, with head nod)\\nD I'll improvise.\\nC SOFIA\\nE (a touch playful)\\nD I don't talk like that.\\nC DAVID\\nD She's right across the room and\\nD she's burning a hole in my back\\nD right now, isn't she?\\nC SOFIA\\nD Red dress, strappy shoes?\\nC DAVID\\nD That's right!\\nN Their heads are close together, looking off into the club.\\nN David doesn't notice that Sofia is having a hard time\\nN playing along with this game. She is overwhelmed, holding\\nN it in. David continues.\\nC DAVID\\nD I think she' s the saddest girl to\\nD ever hold a martini.\\nC SOFIA\\nE (about to burst)\\nC David --\\nC DAVID\\nD Are you okay?\\nC SOFIA\\nD No.\\nC DAVID\\nD What's wrong? Is it me?\\nC SOFIA\\nD I'll tell you later.\\nC DAVID\\nD Come on. Tell me now.\\nD Something's wrong. Tell me\\nD everything. Let's talk about it\\nD right now.\\nO 60\\nC SOFIA\\nD I'll tell you in another life...\\nD when we are both cats.\\nN David looks at her. His eyes flash at her choice of words.\\nN Perhaps there is hope. Sofia stares at. him, worried about\\nN his sanity as he goes overboard with his praise of her turn\\nN of a phrase. Push into close-ups as they struggle to deal\\nN with the discomfort of this moment.\\nC DAVID\\nD I don't believe you just said\\nD that. That. is the best thing I've\\nD ever heard. That is hilarious.\\nD God, that just killed me. The way\\nD you said that. See - that's what\\nD I love about you. \\\"I'll tell you\\nD in another life when we are both\\nD cats.\\\"\\nS EXT. CLUB STREET - NIGHT\\nN David, Brian and Sofia walk swiftly down the street in\\nN silence. David weaves.

I'm\\nD just so fucked up!\\nN Brian stops one last time, irritated, at the far end of the\\nN street.\\nC DAVID\\nD We're best friends! We're bros!\\nN Brian needs to rid himself of David. He turns and runs in\\nN the direction of Sofia.\\nN David feels the deep pangs of rejection. Breathing hard.\\nN His head hurts. His body hurts.\\nC DAVID\\nD Come on, man, we're bros.\\nN Beat. He sprints down the middle of the street after\\nN Brian.\\nS EXT. CLUB STREET/SOFIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\\nN David runs frantically, heartbroken and sobbing.\\nN HIS MIND\\nN Brian catches up to Sofia. She turns, relieved. They kiss\\nN messily, hungrily. Her shoes arch to reach his height.\\nN David runs the streets, nearing her home. The images are\\nN tearing his mind apart. He stops and leans against a car,\\nN unsteady and nauseous. Holding his head in pain, he\\nN manages to run further.\\nN David stops on the street outside her apartment. His sobs\\nN overwhelm him. He drops to the pavement. He passes out,\\nN mouth agape.

But in truth, with Sofia,\\nD it was the in-between times.\\nS INT. FLORENTINE'S BAR AND GRILL - DAY\\nN Sofia laughs. A perfect laugh. David admires her, sits\\nN next to her, holding her hand. Theirs is the unmistakable\\nN closeness of a couple in the first real throes of a sexual\\nN relationship. They share a giddy open secret. Across the\\nN table, we reveal Brian. He's got a tiny high-tech camera.\\nN Sofia speaks sweetly and passionately to David in Spanish.\\nN David replies knowingly - \\\"si\\\"           - every few words. It's a\\nN deep communication. She exits.\\nC BRIAN\\nD What, did she say?\\nC DAVID\\nE (in love)\\nD I have no idea.\\nN Brian shakes his head.\\nO 73\\nC DAVID\\nD How's things, Brian?\\nC BRIAN\\nD Fine.\\nN David's face is huge in the Brian's viewfinder.\\nC DAVID\\nD How's things, Brian?\\nC BRIAN\\nD Don't flatter yourself.

They shake.\\nN DAVID'S POV\\nN David's gaze moves to a 40 year-old man staring at him with\\nN a bemused smile. A plate of food sits in front of him.\\nN His eyes suggest a piercing intellect, he looks at David\\nN with deep familiarity. David can't quite place the face.\\nO 74\\nC BRIAN\\nD Hey what's up with your face?\\nD Fuck, there's a seam opening or\\nD something!\\nC DAVID\\nE (mounting horror)\\nD What - what are you talking about?\\nN Brian laughs. The spell is broken. Friends again.\\nC DAVID\\nD You asshole!\\nS INT. DAVID'S BATHROOM - NIGHT\\nN David sleeps next to Sofia. He sits up, takes a glass of\\nN water from the night-stand, admires his girlfriend and\\nN moves to the bathroom.\\nS INT. BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT\\nN He turns on the light, fills the glass with water. Looks\\nN up into the restored mirror. His face is disfigured. He\\nN recoils in terror, knocking against a towel rack, sinking\\nN to the floor and grabbing a look at a shiny surface on the\\nN lower cabinet.\\nN Sofia bolts upright. She sees him on the floor across the\\nN room, sees his face and backs up in the bed, leaning on her\\nN arm, screaming.\\nS INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\\nN He awakens suddenly. Sofia is next to him, smiling.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Was I snoring?\\nC DAVID\\nE (still breathing heavily)\\nD No, I think it was me.

BATHROOM\\nN Tentatively, he flips the light on. A very relieved David\\nN regards his restored face. He shuts off the light quickly,\\nN and fills the glass of water. Splashes some water on his\\nN face.\\nS INT. BEDROOM\\nN David climbs back into bed.\\nC SOFIA\\nC DAVID\\nE (small laugh)\\nD I could listen to you say \\\"mmmmm\\\"\\nD for the rest of my life.\\nC SOFIA\\nN They kiss. The kiss expands, as he moves to the back of\\nN her neck. He caresses her body. She kisses his\\nN fingertips. Her back to him. Tangled in sheets, they ease\\nN into lovemaking with the perfect fit of two bodies meant\\nN for each other. He gently grabs a handful of her hair.\\nN His hand stops.   It's not Sofia's hair. He slowly turns\\nN her face to his, and we glimpse David over the shoulder of\\nN the woman who is not Sofia. He leaps out of bed, falling\\nN to the floor, the sheet tangled around him. He turns on\\nN the light.\\nN Julie Gianni hides her face from the light, like a night\\nN animal caught in the intrusive glare of day.\\nN When she speaks, it is with Sofia's cadence and accent.\\nC JULIANNA\\nE (scared, uncomprehending)\\nD Baby, what's wrong?\\nN He gasps for breath, backing away. Totally terrified.\\nN Paralyzed. In a low voice:\\nC DAVID\\nD Where. Is. She.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD Who?\\nN His instinct is to protect his lifeline Sofia - and he\\nN pounces on her with a manic will to survive.\\nC 76\\nN Julie Gianni looks a little loopy, almost stoned.\\nN Taunting.\\nC JULIANNA\\nE (taunting, sweet)\\nD I'm Sofia.\\nS INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT - MINUTES LATER\\nN David dismantles the phone, takes the cord. He ties her\\nN willing hands to the posts of the bed. She protests oddly,\\nN like an actress playing a part.\\nC DAVID\\nD Now I'm going to make sure that I\\nD tie this four times. Do you know\\nD why, Julie? Because four times\\nD really means something.\\nN David pulls his pants on, frantically opens the wardrobe\\nN closet. No Sofia. Goes to the kitchen. No Sofia. Julie\\nN sobs quietly, sweetly, tied to the bed. She behaves and\\nN acts like Sofia.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD David, don't hurt me.\\nN David returns and sits across from her on the bed,\\nN terrified and barely hanging on.\\nC DAVID\\nD Okay, I'm freaked out. It worked.\\nD So just tell me right now - where\\nD is Sofia?\\nC JULIANNA\\nD I am Sofia.\\nC DAVID\\nD In one minute I'm going to call\\nD the police --\\nC JULIANNA\\nE (heart breaking)\\nD Don't do it, honey.\\nC DAVID\\nD I knew you'd survived the\\nD accident.\\nN She looks at him with tearful eyes.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD What. accident?\\nO 77\\nC DAVID\\nD Whose body was it? Who's the one\\nD who hired you? The Seven Dwarves?\\nC JULIANNA\\nD I haven't had any accident!\\nC DAVID\\nD No, of course not. It wasn't an\\nD accident at all. It was attempted\\nD murder!\\nC JULIANNA\\nD Honey, please.\\nN He picks up the phone. Dials 911.\\nC DAVID\\nD Police Department? I've captured\\nD an intruder who's entered my home.\\nN He turns to her. Her eyes are yearning.\\nS INT. POLICE STATION/INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT\\nN The flash of mug shots. We see David sitting, sweating,\\nN agitated waiting in a Police station holding room.\\nN Suddenly, the door opens and Thomas Tipp enters, flanked by\\nN other Detectives.\\nC TIPP\\nD Guys, can you give us a minute\\nD here? Detective Larson...\\nD Detective Andrews... thank you.\\nN The room empties, and Tipp approaches David.\\nC DAVID\\nD They think that I had something to\\nD so with this.\\nC TIPP\\nD I'm going to handle this exactly\\nD the way your father would have\\nD handled this. I've got it solved.\\nC DAVID\\nD You've got it solved? Where is\\nD she?\\nC TIPP\\nD She's going to be fine.\\nN David hugs Tipp.\\nO 78\\nC DAVID\\nD Thank God you're here, man. I\\nD love her.\\nC TIPP\\nD Yeah... Now, I want you to look\\nD at these photos and then I'm going\\nD to destroy them. Sofia's\\nD testimony is also in here. It\\nD won't exist. She's not going to\\nD press charges.\\nC DAVID\\nD Press charges against. me?\\nC TIPP\\nD David, wake up. As your friend, I\\nD think you should see what you did\\nD to Sofia. The press won't get\\nD hold of this if you get. away\\nD quickly.\\nN David leans back in his seat. It's all of them - everybody\\nN - against him. Tipp opens a file thick with paperwork, two\\nN computer discs and photos. He displays a photo to David,\\nN moving it into the light so he sees it clearly.              Julie\\nN Gianni, battered.\\nC DAVID\\nD This is Julie Gianni. That's not\\nD Sofia. This is Julie Gianni. I\\nD didn't do that do that to her.\\nE (beginning to shut down)\\nD Tommy, someone's setting me up.\\nC TIPP\\nD David, the Board and I have taken\\nD care of everything. They've been\\nD really great, actually. All of\\nD this is going to disappear. We're\\nD all behind you... even the Board.\\nN David looks at Tipp. It's very clear now. He's one of\\nN them. David attempts calm.\\nC TIPP\\nE (quiet, helpful)\\nD Get out of here.\\nN A migraine is thundering in David's head. His world is\\nN spinning backwards.\\nO 79\\nS INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT\\nN David strides down the hallway. A Man in a crystal blue\\nN sport coat stands, waiting. As David passes, the Man\\nN confides a single line - as if smuggling out a valuable\\nN secret. Voices from other rooms, including a small child\\nN saying: \\\"Mommy, mommy.\\\"\\nN MAN IN BLUE COAT\\nN This is a revolution of the mind.\\nS INT./EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT\\nN Exiting, David is intercepted by a furious Brian.\\nC BRIAN\\nD You're in fucking sad shape, man.\\nD Don't fucking ever hit a girl,\\nD man. Hit me, but don't fucking\\nD EVER hit a girl.\\nN David looks up -- sees a small security camera trained on\\nN them - pulls Brian out of the station.\\nC DAVID\\nD It wasn't Sofia. It was Julie.\\nC BRIAN\\nD Oh... it was Julie Gianni. So,\\nD Sofia was abducted by Julie, and\\nN now Julie is posing as Sofia.\\nC DAVID\\nD Yes.\\nC BRIAN\\nD You're in O.J. land, man. Julie\\nD Gianni is fucking dead!\\nC DAVID\\nD I don't know what the cops have\\nD told you, but let me assure you -\\nD Julie Gianni is alive alive ALIVE.\\nC BRIAN\\nD I didn't talk to the cops.

Look me in\\nD the eye and tell me that it was\\nD the same girl you brought to the\\nD party. Tell me it was your dream\\nD girl, your \\\"proximity\\nD infatuation.\\\"\\nC BRIAN\\nE (raw, finally)\\nD Yes! And you stole her from me!\\nN David backs away, as Brian responds bitterly, from his\\nN heart.\\nC BRIAN\\nD The one girl I really wanted, and\\nD you took her from me. You're\\nD insane. You're losing it, man.\\nD David nods powerfully. He now understands. Brian is one\\nD of them too.\\nC DAVID\\nD You have revealed yourself.\\nC BRIAN\\nD Oh yeah, I'm with them.\\nC DAVID\\nD Where'd you get the coat, Brian?\\nD Where'd you get the camera? How\\nD much did they pay you?\\nC BRIAN\\nD Listen to me, 'cause it's the last\\nD time we're ever gonna speak. I\\nD was your only friend.\\nC DAVID\\nD You have revealed yourself to me.\\nS INT. FLORENTINE'S - NIGHT\\nN David nurses a drink, still breathing heavily. He's been\\nN crying. His head aches with this thought - maybe I am\\nN insane. A man in a classy suit walks towards him, inviting\\nN himself to sit at the table. His bedside manner is\\nN impeccable. His smile offers infinite compassion. He was\\nN the man staring at. him in this same restaurant.

And first\\nD of all, it's very important that\\nD you calm down.\\nC DAVID\\nD Calm down?\\nC VENTURA\\nD You must overcome your fears and\\nD regain control. Take hold of your\\nD life again.

Nothing to do\\nD with you -\\nO 82\\nN David listens, as he looks at the spirited Saturday night\\nN crowd, lost in their revelry.\\nC VENTURA\\nD -- and yet, they might only be here\\nD because you wanted them to be.\\nD You are their God. And not only\\nD that, you could make them obey\\nD you... or even destroy you.\\nN David shakes his head, exhausted and in no mood. He shuts\\nN his eyes, fights off a headache.\\nC DAVID\\nE (cutting him off)\\nD What I'd like them to do is shut\\nD up! Especially you!\\nN Silence. David opens his eyes. They're all staring at\\nN him. Casually waiting for orders.\\nC VENTURA\\nD You see?\\nN David looks at him with horror, backing away.

SOFIA'S APARTMENT - DAY - FLASHBACK\\nN The clown figurine on her stove-top falls over as we hear\\nN the front door kicked in. David enters, slamming the door\\nN behind him. He looks around what was once the site of such\\nN happiness. The same details he'd glimpsed long ago are now\\nN horrifying to him. He looks at a photo on the\\nN refrigerator. The same note: Call Dad! The exact\\nN expression, exact photograph he'd seen on his earlier\\nN visit. Now it is Julie who is in her place.\\nN He opens her drawer. Just some papers. And then... the\\nN drawing he'd once done of her. Now featuring Julie. He\\nN rips up the drawing, and proceeds to destroy the apartment\\nN until he stops, collecting himself. Takes a breath and...\\nN Smash. A lamp is broken over his head. Julie Gianni bends\\nN down to help him. A shard of the lamp-base is still in her\\nN hand. Julie's whole demeanor is that of a different girl.\\nN Even her voice is softer, almost exactly the knock-around\\nN sweetness of Sofia.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD I thought you were a vandal.\\nC DAVID\\nE (with difficulty)\\nD Who... are... you?\\nC JULIANNA\\nD I'm Sofia.\\nC DAVID\\nD You are not Sofia... you're not\\nD Sofia...\\nO 85\\nC JULIANNA\\nD I'm Sofia.\\nC DAVID\\nD Whatever.\\nN Julie starts to cry. Battling tears, she offers her heart\\nN and soul.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD David, honey. This will all be\\nD over soon. We'll be together\\nD again. You'll forget Julianna and\\nD I won't be afraid of you. Let me\\nD get you a cold towel.\\nN She exits. He struggles to rise. His head is a swirling\\nN mess. And then:\\nS ON KITCHEN DOORWAY\\nN Sofia slowly returns with towel. Her image still blurry.\\nN David advances, and faints into her arms.\\nC DAVID\\nD Sofia?\\nC SOFIA\\nE (whispers)\\nD Yes, David, I'm Sofia. I'm Sofia.\\nN He accepts it, all of it, whatever it is, just to hold her.\\nN They kiss, gently, then more powerfully.\\nS INT. SOFIA'S BEDROOM - DAY\\nN They make love, emotionally and deeply. Two bodies\\nN yearning to possess the other. Camera moves across their\\nN bodies, as David wipes frame to black, as the move\\nN continues onto her back.\\nC DAVID\\nD Where were you...\\nN Sofia doesn't answer, doesn't want to lose the moment.\\nC DAVID\\nD I don't want to know.\\nE (thrusting)\\nD Just tell me you love me.\\nN David keeps his face buried in her shoulder'. He doesn't\\nN want to look. The passion gives way to a mounting dread,\\nN as he hears a voice almost like Sofia's.\\nO 86\\nC JULIANNA (O.S.)\\nD I love you. I'm afraid of how\\nD powerful this is.\\nN He continues moving passionately, harder now. Julie\\nN responds to the overwhelming surge within David. She gives\\nN over to the waves of dark pleasure, riding him like a\\nN rocket. from hell. Harder now. Grabbing her hands and\\nN pulling them high above her head, clamping down with his\\nN own.\\nN Julie Gianni cries a deep, guttural sound of passion.\\nN This is what someone sounds like when they're not faking\\nN it. And then... slam... a pillow comes down over her face.\\nC DAVID\\nN What the fuck is happening?\\nN Julie begins to react to what is clearly no longer an\\nN advanced lovemaking session.\\nC DAVID\\nD I want to see your face!\\nN She grabs at the pillow.\\nC DAVID\\nD I want to see your face!\\nN David reaches orgasm, sobbing, recklessly out of control.\\nN Julie's body stops kicking and settles into silence. He\\nN loosens the pillow, and is rewarded with one last violent\\nN attempt at life. Her hand smacks his neck. He's so taut\\nN it bounces off. She grabs at his face one last time, her\\nN hand is left with enough power only to caress his face.\\nN She goes limp. Silence. David's crying turns to a\\nN whimper. He looks at the pillow over Julie's head. He's\\nN confused, a puddle of jagged adrenaline. He doesn't want\\nN to remove the pillow for fear of who could be underneath.\\nN He rises up, his elbow across her lifeless chest. With\\nN true horror, he knows he has to move his hand, but his hand\\nN will reveal who he's just killed.\\nN ON HER TORSO\\nN as his arm moves inexorably away from her chest. Quarter-\\nN inch by quarter-inch he inches it downward, across the top\\nN of her breasts... dreading the inevitable, not seeing it,\\nN and then... there it is. The mole between her breasts.\\nS INT. HALLWAY STAIRS - DAY\\nN David exits hurriedly, past some tenants, down the stairs.\\nN He looks up at his own reflection in the hallway mirror.\\nO 87\\nN He looks horribly disfigured.

Our angle looks straight\\nN up.\\nN Now an angle looking steeply down: the snow falls not quite dead\\nN away to collect on a\\nN foreground chimneypot and on the little shtetl street that lies\\nN maplike below us.\\nN It is night, and quiet, and the street is deserted except for\\nN one man who walks away from\\nN us, his valenki squeaking in the fresh snow. He carries bundled\\nN branches on one shoulder\\nN and has a hatchet tucked into his belt.\\nN We cut down to street level. The man walks toward us, bearded,\\nN and bundled against the\\nN cold. Smiling, he mutters in Yiddish-the dialogue subtitled.\\nC MAN\\nD What a marvel... what a marvel...\\nS HOUSE INTERIOR\\nN As its door opens and the man enters.\\nC MAN\\nC Dora!\\nC VOICE\\nD Yes...\\nN The man crosses to the stove with his bundle of wood. The voice\\nO continues:\\nO 2\\nD . Can you help me with the ice?\\nN The man dumps the wood into a box by the stove as his wife enters\\nN with an ice pick.\\nD . I expected you hours ago.\\nC MAN\\nD You can't imagine what just happened. I was coming back\\nN on the Lublin road when the wheel came off the cart\\nD thank heavens it was the way back and I'd already sold the\\nD geese!\\nC WIFE\\nD How much?\\nC MAN\\nD Fifteen groshen, but that's not the story. I was struggling to\\nN set the cart upright when a droshky approaches from the\\nN direction of Lvov. How lucky, you think, that someone is\\nD out this late.\\nC WIFE\\nD Yes, very remarkable.\\nC MAN\\nD But that's the least of it! He stops to help me; we talk of\\nD this, we talk of that-it turns out this is someone you know!\\nD Traitle Groshkover!\\nN His wife stares at him as he beams.\\nN He takes the stare as a sign that she can't place the name.\\nN . You know, REB GROSHKOVER! Pesel Bunim's uncle!\\nN The chacham from Lodz, who studied under the Zohar reb\\nN in Krakow!\\nN Still she stares. Then, quietly:\\nC WIFE\\nD God has cursed us.\\nC MAN\\nD What?\\nC WIFE\\nD Traitle Groshkover has been dead for three years.\\nN Laughter erupts from the man but, as his wife continues to stare\\nN at him, he strangles on it.\\nN Quiet.\\nS Wind whistles under the eaves.\\nN The man says quietly:\\nC MAN\\nD Why do you say such a thing! I saw the man! I talked to him!\\nC WIFE\\nD You talked to a dybbuk. Traitle Groshkover died of typhus\\nN in Pesel Bunim's house. Pesel told me-she sat shiva for\\nD him.\\nN They stare at each through a silence broken only by the sound\\nN of the quickening wind.\\nN A rap at the door.\\nN Neither immediately responds.\\nN Finally, to her husband:\\nC Who is it?\\nD MAN\\nN For some soup, to warm himself.\\nN The wind moans. He helped me, Dora!\\nN THE DOOR\\nN We are looking in from the outside as it unlatches and creaks\\nN in, opened by the husband\\nN in the foreground, who has arranged his face into a strained\\nN look of greeting. In the\\nN background the wife stares, hollow-eyed.\\nC MAN\\nN REB GROSHKOVER! You are welcome here!\\nN Reverse on REB GROSHKOVER: a short, merry-looking fellow with\\nN a bifurcated beard and a\\nN silk hat and spectacles. He gives a little squeal of delight.\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD You are too kind, Velvel! Too kind!\\nN He steps into the house and sees the wife staring at him.\\nD And you must be Dora! So much I have heard of you!\\nD Yes, your cheeks are pink and your legs are stout! What a\\nD wife you have!\\nN The husband chuckles nervously.\\nC MAN\\nD Yes! A ray of sun, a ray of sun! Sit!\\nC WIFE\\nD My husband said he offered you soup.\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD Yes, but I couldn't possibly eat this late, or I'd have\\nD nightmares. No, no: no soup for me!\\nC WIFE\\nD I knew it.\\nN REB GROSHKOVER laughs.\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD I see! You think I'm fat enough already!\\nN He settles, chuckling, into his chair, but Dora remains sober:\\nC WIFE\\nD No. A dybbuk doesn't eat.\\nO 5\\nN REB GROSHKOVER stares at her, shocked.\\nN The wife returns the stare.\\nN The husband looks from wife to REB GROSHKOVER, apprehensive.\\nN A heavy silence.\\nN REB GROSHKOVER bursts into pealing laughter.\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD What a wife you have!\\nN He wipes away tears of merriment; the husband relaxes, even begins\\nN to smile.\\nC MAN\\nD I assure you, REB GROSHKOVER, it's nothing personal; she\\nD heard a story you had died, three years ago, at Pesel\\nD Bunim's house. This is why she think you are a dybbuk; I,\\nD of course, do not believe in such things. I am a rational\\nD man.\\nN REB GROSHKOVER is still chuckling.\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD Oh my. Oh my yes. What nonsense. And even if there\\nD were spirits, certainly...\\nN He thumps his chest.\\nD I am not one of them!\\nC WIFE\\nD Pesel always worried. Your corpse was left unattended for\\nD many minutes when Pesel's father broke shiva and left the\\nD room-it must have been then that the Evil One-\\nN She breaks off to spit at the mention of the Evil One.\\nD -took you!\\nN REB GROSHKOVER is terribly amused:\\nO 6\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD \\\"My corpse!\\\" Honestly! What a wife you have!\\nC WIFE\\nD Oh yes? Look, husband...\\nN She steps forward to the Reb, who looks enquiringly up at her.\\nN They were preparing the body. Pesel's father shaved\\nD one check...\\nN As his eyes roll down to look at her hand, she draws it across\\nN his smooth right cheek.\\nN Then he left the room. He came back, and shaved the\\nD other...\\nN She reaches across to the other cheek, REB GROSHKOVER's eyes\\nN following her hand-\\nD You were already gone!\\nN -and drags her hand across. A bristly sound.\\nN REB GROSHKOVER laughs.\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD I shaved hastily this morning and missed a bit-by you this\\nD makes me a dybbuk?\\nD He appeals to the husband:\\nD It's true, I was sick with typhus when I stayed with\\nD Peselle, but I recovered, as you can plainly see, and now\\nD I-hugh!\\nN The wife steps back.\\nN REB GROSHKOVER looks slowly down at his own chest in which the\\nN wife has just planted an\\nN ice pick.\\nN REB GROSHKOVER stares at the ice pick.\\nN The wife stares.\\nO 7\\nN The husband stares.\\nN Suddenly, REB GROSHKOVER bursts out laughing:\\nN What a wife you have!\\nN The husband can manage only a shocked whisper:\\nC MAN\\nD Woman, what have you done?\\nN REB GROSHKOVER again looks down at his chest, which again moves\\nN him to laughter. He\\nN shakes his head.\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD Why would she do such a thing?\\nN He looks up.\\nN I ask you, Velvel, as a rational man: which of us is\\nD possessed?\\nC WIFE\\nD What do you say now about spirits? He is unharmed!\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD On the contrary! I don't feel at all well.\\nD And indeed, blood has begun to soak through his vest.\\nN He chuckles with less energy.\\nN One does a mitzvah and this is the thanks one gets?\\nC MAN\\nD Dora! Woe, woe! How can such a thing be!\\nC REB GROSHKOVER\\nD Perhaps I will have some soup. I am feeling weak...\\nN He rises to his feet but totters.\\nD Or perhaps I should go...\\nO 8\\nN He smiles weakly at Dora..\\nN One knows when one isn't wanted.\\nN He walks unsteadily to the door, opens it with some effort, and\\nN staggers out into the\\nN moaning wind and snow to be swallowed by the night.\\nN The wife and husband stare at the door banging in the wind.\\nN FINALLY:\\nC MAN\\nD Dear wife. We are ruined. Tomorrow they will discover\\nN the body. All is lost.\\nC WIFE\\nD Nonsense, Velvel...\\nN She walks to the door...\\nN Blessed is the Lord. Good riddance to evil and shuts it against\\nN the wind.\\nN BLACK\\nN A drumbeat thumps in the black.\\nN Music blares: the Jefferson Airplane. Grace Slick's voice enters:\\nN When the truth is found to be lies\\nN And all the hope inside you dies\\nN Don't you want somebody to love. . .\\nN An image fades in slowly, but even up full it is dim: some kind\\nN of round, dull white shape\\nN with a small black pinhole center. This white half-globe is a\\nN plug set in a flesh-toned\\nN field. The flesh tone glows translucently, backlit. We are drifting\\nN toward the white plug\\nN and, as we do so, the music grows louder still.\\nN AN EARPIECE\\nO 9\\nN A pull back-a reverse on the preceding push in-from the cheap\\nN white plastic earpiece\\nN of a transistor radio. The Jefferson Airplane continues over\\nN the cut but becomes\\nN extremely compressed. The pull back reveals that the earpiece\\nN is lodged in someone's\\nN ear and trails a white cord.\\nN We drift down the cord to find the radio at its other end. As\\nD we do so we hear, live in the\\nN room, many voices speaking a foreign language in unison. A classroom,\\nN apparently.\\nN The radio is on a desktop but hidden from in front by the book\\nN held open before it. The\\nN book is written in non-Roman characters.\\nN We are in Hebrew school.\\nN The boy who is listening to the transistor radio-DANNY Gopnik-sits\\nN at a hinge-topped\\nN desk in a cinderblock classroom whose rows of desks are occupied\\nN by other boys and\\nN girls of about twelve years of age. It is dusk and the room is\\nN flourescent-lit.\\nN At the front of the room a gray-haired man in a worn suit and\\nN tie addresses the class.\\nN DANNY straightens one leg so that he may dig into a pocket. With\\nN an eye on the TEACHER to\\nN make sure he isn't being watched, he eases something out:\\nN A twenty-dollar bill.\\nN TEACHER\\nN Mee yodayah? Reuven? Rifkah? Mah zeh \\\"anakim\\\"?\\nN Efsheh mashooach ba-avodah?\\nN A BLINDING LIGHT\\nN At the cut to the light the Jefferson Airplane music jumps up\\nN full. The light resolves into\\nN a multi-flared image of a blinking eye.\\nN Reverse: the inside of a human ear. Fleshy whorls finely veined,\\nN a cavity receding to\\nN dark.\\nN Objective on the DOCTOR's office: the DOCTOR is peering through\\nN a lightscope into the ear of\\nN an early-middle-aged man, LARRY Gopnik.\\nN The Jefferson Airplane music continues.\\nO 10\\nC DOCTOR\\nD Uh-huh.\\nC HEBREW SCHOOL\\nN Close on Hebrew characters being scribbled onto the blackboard\\nN as the TEACHER talks.\\nN The TEACHER, talking.\\nN A bored child, staring off.\\nN His point-of-view: a blacktopped parking lot with a few orange\\nS school busses, beyond it a\\nN marshy field, and distant suburban bungalows.\\nN Close on another child staring at something through drooping\\nN eyelids.\\nN His point-of-view: very close on the face of a classroom clock.\\nN We hear its electrical\\nN hum. Its red sweep-second hand crawls around the dial very, very\\nN slowly.\\nN DANNY Gopnik hisses:\\nC DANNY\\nD Fagle!.. .\\nN The TEACHER drones on, writing on the blackboard. DANNY's eyes\\nN flit from the TEACHER to\\nN the student sitting kitty-corner in front of him-a husky youth\\nN with shaggy hair. He\\nN hasn't heard the prompt.\\nD . Fagle!\\nN The TEACHER turns from the blackboard and DANNY leans back, eyes\\nN front, folding the\\nN twenty up small behind his book.\\nC TEACHER\\nN Ahnee rotzeh lalechet habait hakisai. Mee yodayah?\\nN Misaviv tamid anachnoo tamid...\\nN The clock-watching child, eyelids sinking, is beginning to drool\\nN out of one side of his\\nD mouth.\\nS DOCTOR'S OFFICE\\nO 11\\nN The light again flaring the lens.\\nN Reverse: looking into a pupil.\\nN Objective: the DOCTOR looking through his scope into LARRY's\\nN eye.\\nC DOCTOR\\nD Mm-hmm.\\nC HEBREW SCHOOL\\nN A bored child is excavating a bugger from his nose.\\nN The TEACHER turns back to the chalkboard to circle something.\\nC DANNY\\nD Fagle!\\nC TEACHER\\nC Hamrah oomoh-\\nN He interrupts himself briefly to make a couple of phlegm-hawking\\nN sounds. He resumes:\\nN . Hamrah oomoh meshiach oomshel zal?\\nS DOCTOR'S OFFICE\\nN The DOCTOR palpates LARRY's midriff, digging his fingers into\\nN the hairy, baggy flesh.\\nC DOCTOR's Voice\\nD Uh-huh. We'll do some routine X-rays.\\nC HEBREW SCHOOL\\nN A young girl holds a hank of her bangs in front of her face,\\nN separating out individual hairs\\nN to examine them for split ends.\\nC TEACHER\\nN Ahnoo ahnoo mah? Mah? Talmidim? D'vorah?\\nO 12\\nC D'VORAH\\nD Ahnee to yodayah.\\nN The TEACHER begins to pace the desk aisles, looking back and\\nN forth among the students.\\nC TEACHER\\nD Mee yodayah?\\nD The bugger-seeker, having succesfully withdrawn a bugger, carefully\\nN drapes it over the\\nN sharp end of his pencil, to what end we cannot know.\\nN DANNY, apprehensively eyeing the TEACHER, slides the twenty into\\nN the transistor radio's\\nN cover-sleeve.\\nM X-RAY CONE\\nN A huge white rubberized cone, pointed directly at us.\\nN We hear a rush of static and the DOCTOR's voice filtered through\\nN a talk-back:\\nN DOCTOR's Voice\\nD Hold still.\\nN Wider: LARRY is in his shorts lying on his back on an examining\\nN table covered by a sheet\\nN of tissue paper. The X-ray cone is pointed at the middle of his\\nN body.\\nN There is a brief sci-fi-like machine hum. It clicks off.\\nN HEBREW SCHOOL\\nN The clock-watching student's head is making descending bobs toward\\nN his chest.\\nC TEACHER\\nD Nefsheh shelach hamilamid-eh?!\\nN The TEACHER's circuit of the classroom has taken him around behind\\nN DANNY. DANNY's\\nN book lies face-down on the desk, covering the radio, but the\\nN white cord snakes out from\\nN under it up to his ear.\\nN The TEACHER yanks at the cord.\\nO 13\\nN The cord pops out of its jack and the Jefferson Airplane blares\\nN tinnily from beneath the\\nS book of torah stories.\\nN The TEACHER lifts the book to expose the jangling radio.\\nN Outraged, the TEACHER projects above the music:\\nN . Mah zeh? ! Mah zeh? !\\nN Some of the students are singing along; a couple beat rhythm\\nN on their desks.\\nN . Shechet, talmidim! Anachnoo lo cam zeh b'bait sefer!\\nN Shechet bivakasha!\\nN Three other students join in a chorus:\\nD STUDENTS\\nN Shechet! Shechet bivakasha!\\nN The nodding student's head droops ever lower.\\nN Other students join in the chant:\\nN SHECHET! SHECHET! SHECHET BIVAKASHA!\\nN The nodding student's chin finally reaches, and settles on, his\\nN chest, and he gives a long\\nN snorfling inhale of sleep.\\nS DOCTOR'S OFFICE\\nN LARRY, now fully clothed, is seated across from the DOCTOR.\\nN The DOCTOR is looking at his file. He absently taps a cigarette\\nN out of a pack and lights up.\\nN He nods as he smokes, looking at the file.\\nC DOCTOR\\nD Well, I-sorry.\\nN He holds the pack toward LARRY.\\nO 14\\nC LARRY\\nD No thanks.\\nC DOCTOR\\nD Well, you're in good health. How're Judith and the kids?\\nC LARRY\\nD Good. Everyone's good. You know.\\nN The DOCTOR takes a long suck.\\nC DOCTOR\\nD Good. Daniel must be-what? About to be bar mitzvah?\\nC LARRY\\nD Two weeks.\\nC DOCTOR\\nD Well, mazel tov. They grow up fast, don't they?\\nS TINTED PHOTO PORTRAIT\\nN The portrait, old, in an ornate gilt frame, is of a middle-aged\\nN rabbi with a small neat\\nN mustache and round spectacles. He wears a tallis hood-style and\\nN a phylactery box is\\nN strapped to his forehead. A plaque set into the frame identifies\\nN the man as Rabbi Minda.\\nN Wider shows that the portrait hangs in the Hebrew school principal's\\nN office, a white\\nN cinderblock room. It is quiet. The only sound is a deep electrical\\nN hum.\\nN Just visible behind the principal's desk, upon which is a low\\nN stack of books and a name\\nN plate identifying the occupant as MAR TURCHIK, is the top of\\nN a man's head-an old\\nN man, with a few whispy white hairs where his yarmulka is not.\\nN DANNY, seated opposite, pushes up from his slouch to better see\\nN across the desk.\\nN We boom up to show more of the principal. He is short. He wears\\nN a white shirt and\\nN hoist-up pants that come to just below his armpits. He has thick\\nN eyeglasses. He fiddles\\nN with the transistor radio, muttering:\\nC PRINCIPAL\\nD Hmm... eh... nu?\\nO 15\\nN He experiments with different dials on the radio.\\nN DANNY nervously watches.\\nC DANNY\\nD You put the-\\nN The old man holds up one hand.\\nC PRINCIPAL\\nE In ivrit. (In Hebrew)\\nC DANNY\\nD Um...\\nN The old man looks down at the little earpiece pinched between\\nN two fingers. He examines\\nN it as a superstitious native might a Coca-Cola bottle.\\nN The source of the electrical hum: a wall clock whose red sweep-second\\nN hand crawls\\nN around the dial very, very slowly.\\nN The Reb continues to squint at the earpiece.\\nN DANNY sighs. He encourages:\\nC DANNY\\nD Yeah, you-\\nN The principal's tone is harder:\\nC PRINCIPAL\\nD In ivrit!\\nN This time his cold look holds until he is sure that the admonishment\\nN has registered.\\nN He looks back down at the earpiece.\\nN We hear the door open. The principal ignores it.\\nN An old woman walks slowly in with a teacup chattering on a saucer.\\nN She has thick\\nN eyeglasses. She wears thick flesh-colored support hose. She takes\\nN slow, short steps\\nN toward the desk. The principal is studying the radio.\\nO 16\\nC PRINCIPAL\\nD Mneh...\\nN The old woman continues to take slow short steps toward him.\\nN The tableau looks like a\\nN performance-art piece.\\nN She reaches the desk and sets the teacup down. She summons a\\nN couple of phlegm-\\nN hawking rasps and turns to go.\\nN She takes slow short steps toward the door.\\nN The principal raises the earpiece experimentally toward his ear.\\nN Close on his hairy, wrinkled ear as his trembling fingers bring\\nN in the earpiece. The\\nN i f ngers push and wobble and tamp the earpiece into place, hesitate,\\nN and then do some\\nN more pushing and wobbling and tamping.\\nN The principal keeps DANNY fixed with a stare as his hand hesitantly\\nN drops from his ear,\\nN ready to reach back up should the earpiece loosen.\\nN .mneh...\\nN Satisfied that neither the student nor the earpiece are about\\nN to make any sudden moves, he\\nN looks down at the radio. He turns a dial.\\nN Faintly and tinnily from the earpiece we hear the compressed\\nN jangle of rock music. The\\nN rabbi stares blankly, listening.\\nN DANNY slumps, looking warily at the rabbi.\\nN The rabbi continues to stare down at the radio. The compressed\\nN rock music jangles on.\\nN The rabbi is expressionless, mouth slightly open, listening.\\nN Tableau: anxious student, earplugged spiritual leader.\\nN Muffled, from the outer office, the hawking of phlegm.\\nC CLASSROOM\\nN We are behind a man who writes equations on a chalkboard, shoulder\\nN at work and hand\\nN quickly waggling. Periodically he glances back, giving us a fleeting\\nN look at his face: it is\\nO 17\\nC LARRY Gopnik.\\nC LARRY\\nD You following this?... Okay?.. So... Heh-heh... This\\nD part is exciting...\\nN Students follow along, bored.\\nC LARRY continues to write.\\nD . So, okay. So. So if that's that, then we can do this,\\nN right? Is that right? Isn't that right? And that's\\nN Schrodinger's paradox, right? Is the cat dead or is the cat\\nN not dead? Okay?\\nS BLEGEN HALL\\nN LARRY is entering the physics department office. The department's\\nN secretary wheels her\\nN castored chair away from her typing.\\nC SECRETARY\\nD Messages, Professor Gopnik.\\nN He takes the three phone messages.\\nC LARRY\\nD Thank you, Natalie. Oh-CLIVE. Come in.\\nD A Korean graduate student who was been waiting on a straightbacked\\nN chair rises.\\nC LARRY'S OFFICE\\nN He is flipping through the messages. Absently:\\nC LARRY\\nD So, uh, what can I do for you?\\nD The messages:\\nN WHILE YOU WERE OUT Dick Dutton\\nN OF Columbia Record Club\\nO 18\\nC CALLED.\\nD REGARDING: \\\"Please call.\\\"\\nD WHILE YOU WERE OUT Sy Ableman\\nD CALLED.\\nN REGARDING \\\"Let's talk.\\\"\\nS WHILE YOU WERE OUT CLIVE Park\\nD CALLED.\\nN REGARDING: \\\"Unjust test results.\\\"\\nN He crumples the last one.\\nC CLIVE\\nD Uh, Dr. Gopnik, I believe the results of Physics Mid-Term\\nD were unjust.\\nC LARRY\\nD Uh-huh, how so?\\nC CLIVE\\nD I received an unsatisfactory grade. In fact: F, the failing\\nD grade.\\nC LARRY\\nD Uh, yes. You failed the mid-term. That's accurate.\\nC CLIVE\\nD Yes, but this is not just. I was unaware to be examined on\\nD the mathematics.\\nC LARRY\\nD Well-you can't do physics without mathematics, really,\\nD can you.\\nC CLIVE\\nD If I receive failing grade I lose my scholarship, and feel\\nD shame. I understand the physics. I understand the dead cat.\\nC LARRY\\nE (SURPRISED)\\nD You understand the dead cat?\\nO 19\\nC CLIVE nods gravely.\\nD But... you... you can't really understand the physics\\nN without understanding the math. The math tells how it\\nD really works. That's the real thing; the stories I give you in\\nN class are just illustrative; they're like, fables, say, to help\\nN give you a picture. An imperfect model. I mean-even I\\nN don't understand the dead cat. The math is how it really\\nN works.\\nN CLIVE shakes his head, dubious.\\nC CLIVE\\nD Very difficult... very difficult...\\nC LARRY\\nD Well, I... I'm sorry, but I... what do you propose?\\nC CLIVE\\nD Passing grade.\\nC LARRY\\nD No no, I-\\nC CLIVE\\nD Or perhaps I can take the mid-term again. Now I know it\\nD covers mathematics.\\nC LARRY\\nD Well, the other students wouldn't like that, would they. If\\nD one student gets to retake the test til he gets a grade he\\nD likes.\\nN CLIVE impassively considers this.\\nC CLIVE\\nD Secret test.\\nN LARRY wraps a hand wearily over his eyes.\\nC LARRY\\nD . No, I'm afraid-\\nO 20\\nC CLIVE\\nD Hush-hush.\\nC LARRY\\nD No, that's just not workable. I'm afraid we'll just have to\\nD bite the bullet on this thing, CLIVE, and-\\nC CLIVE\\nD Very troubling.\\nN He rises.\\nN . very troubling...\\nN He goes to the door, shaking his head, as LARRY looks on in surprise.\\nN He leaves.\\nN LARRY stares at the open door. The secretary outside, her back\\nN to us, types on.\\nN LARRY. looks stupidly around his own office, shakes his head.\\nN He picks up the phone message from Sy Ableman-\\\"Let's talk\\\"-and\\nN dials. As he dials\\nN his other hand wanders over the papers on the desktop.\\nN There is a plain white envelope on the desk. LARRY picks it up\\nN as the phone rings through.\\nN A ring is clipped short and a warm basso-baritone rumbles through\\nN the line:\\nN Phone Voice\\nD Sy Ableman.\\nC LARRY\\nD Hello, Sy, LARRY Gopnik.\\nC SY\\nE (MOURNFUL)\\nD LARRY. How are you, my friend.\\nN LARRY picks idly at the envelope.\\nC LARRY\\nD Good, how've you been, Sy?\\nO 21\\nN Inside the envelope: a thick sheaf of one-hundred-dollar bills.\\nC SY\\nD Oh fine. Shall we talk LARRY.\\nN LARRY reacts to the money.\\nC LARRY\\nE (into phone)\\nD What?! Oh! Sorry! I, uh-call back!\\nN He slams down the phone.\\nN . CLIVE!\\nN He rushes out the door, through the secretarial area, and into\\nN the hallway, and looks up\\nN toward the elevators.\\nN Empty.\\nN He looks at the stuffed envelope he still holds.\\nN He goes back to the departmental office.

Will\\nD you set the table?\\nC SARAH\\nD Why can't he do it in the basement? Or go out in the\\nS garage!\\nC BUS\\nD We are raking the exterior of an orange school bus as it rattles\\nN along. Hebrew characters\\nD on the side identify it-to some, anyway.\\nS INSIDE\\nN We are locked down on DANNY as the bus rattles like an old crate,\\nN squeaking, grinding\\nN gears, belching exhaust. DANNY and the children around him vibrate\\nN and pitch about but,\\nN from their lack of reaction, seem used to it.\\nN They raise their voices to be heard over the engine noise and\\nN the various stress noises in\\nN the chassis and a transistor radio somewhere that plays Jefferson\\nN Airplane.\\nC DANNY\\nD I had twenty bucks in it too.

Out in a minute!\\nC LARRY\\nD We should wait.\\nC SARAH\\nD Are you kidding!\\nN They start eating.\\nC LARRY\\nD Mr. Brandt keeps mowing part of our lawn.\\nC JUDY\\nD Does that matter?\\nC LARRY\\nD What?\\nC JUDY\\nD Is it important?\\nN LARRY shrugs.\\nC LARRY\\nD It's just odd.\\nO 26\\nC JUDY\\nD Any news on your tenure?\\nC LARRY\\nD I think they'll give me tenure.\\nC JUDY\\nD You think.\\nC LARRY\\nE (EQUABLY)\\nD Well, I don't know.

Which is why I ask.\\nC LARRY\\nD WELL-\\nC SARAH\\nD Mom, how long is Uncle Arthur staying with us?\\nC JUDY\\nD Ask your father.\\nS BACK YARD\\nD Twilight.\\nN LARRY is stepping onto a hose as he unwheels it from the drum\\nN of a traveling sprinkler,\\nN laying out an are to cover the back yard. Intermittent thwacks\\nS from next door:\\nN Gar Brandt and his son, who also has a buzz cut and a white T-shirt,\\nN throw a baseball\\nN back and forth. Gar Brandt throws hard. The ball pops in the\\nN boy's mitt.\\nC MITCH\\nD Ow.\\nN LARRY walks over to the boundary defined by the fresh mowing.\\nN He sights down it.\\nN Gar Brandt looks over his shoulder at LARRY, looking. Gar Brandt\\nN is expressionless. He\\nO 27\\nN goes back to throwing.\\nC MITCH\\nD Ow.\\nS INSIDE\\nN Evening. Lights on. LARRY sits at the kitchen table, a briefcase\\nN open on the chair next to\\nN him. Blue books-examination booklets-are spread on the table\\nN in front of him. He\\nN reads, occasionally making marginal scribbles, grading.\\nN From off, faint and dulled by intervening walls, rock music:\\nN somewhere in the house\\nN DANNY is listening to the Jefferson Airplane.\\nN The clink of teaspoon against china as LARRY stirs his tea. He\\nN looks up at a noise: JUDY\\nN enters.\\nC JUDY\\nD Honey.\\nC LARRY\\nE (ABSENT)\\nD Honey.\\nC JUDY\\nD Did you talk to Sy?\\nD Still absent, without looking up:\\nC LARRY\\nD Sy?-Sy Ableman!-That's right, he called, but I-\\nC JUDY\\nD You didn't talk to him.\\nC LARRY\\nD No, I-\\nC JUDY\\nD You know the problems you and I have been having.\\nD Sympathetic, but still absent:\\nO 28\\nC LARRY\\nD Mm.\\nC JUDY\\nD Well, Sy and I have become very close.\\nN This brings LARRY's head up. He focuses on JUDY, puzzled. She\\nN elaborates:\\nN In.short: I think it's time to start talking about a divorce.\\nN LARRY stares at her. A long beat.\\nN At length, trying to digest:\\nC LARRY\\nD . Sy Ableman!\\nC JUDY\\nD This is not about Sy.\\nC LARRY\\nD You mentioned Sy!\\nC JUDY\\nD Don't twist my words. We-\\nC LARRY\\nD A divorce-what have I done! I haven't done anything-\\nD What have I done!\\nC JUDY\\nD LARRY, don't be a child. You haven't \\\"done\\\" anything. I\\nD haven't \\\"done\\\" anything.\\nC LARRY\\nD Yes! Yes! We haven't done anything! And I-I'm\\nD probably about to get tenure!\\nC JUDY\\nD Nevertheless, there have been problems. As you know.\\nC LARRY\\nO 29\\nD WELL-\\nC JUDY\\nD And things have changed. And then-Sy Ableman. Sy has\\nD come into my life. And now-\\nC LARRY\\nD Come into your-what does that mean?! You, you, you,\\nD you barely know him!\\nC JUDY\\nD We've known the Ablemans for fifteen years.\\nC LARRY\\nD Yes, but you you said we hadn't done anything!\\nN JUDY suddenly is stony:\\nC JUDY\\nD I haven't done anything. This is not some flashy fling.\\nD This is not about woopsy-doopsy.\\nN LARRY stares at her.\\nC LARRY\\nD Sy Ableman!\\nN From down the hall, a knock on a door. A muffled voice:\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Out in a minute!\\nC JUDY\\nD Look, I didn't know any other way of breaking it to you.\\nD Except to tell you. And treat you like an adult. Is that so\\nD wrong?\\nN LARRY does not seem to be listening. His eyes roam the room as\\nN he thinks.\\nC LARRY\\nD Where do I sleep?\\nN JUDY narrows her eyes.\\nO 30\\nC JUDY\\nD What?\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur's on the couch!\\nC JUDY\\nD Look. Sy feels that we should-\\nC LARRY\\nD Esther is barely cold!\\nC JUDY\\nD Esther died three years ago. And it was a loveless\\nD marriage. Sy wants a Gett.\\nN This derails the conversation. LARRY stares, trying to pick up\\nN the thread.\\nC LARRY\\nD . A what?\\nC JUDY\\nD A ritual divorce. He says it's very important. Without a\\nD Gett I'm an Aguna.\\nC LARRY\\nD A what? What are you talking about?\\nN She turns to go, shaking her head, peeved:\\nC JUDY\\nD You always act so surprised.\\nN As she leaves:\\nN I have begged you to see the Rabbi.\\nT FADE IN\\nN LARRY has fallen asleep at the kitchen table, face-down in a\\nN pile of blue books. Cold blue\\nN light sweeps across him and he looks up.\\nO 31\\nN A short, balding middle-aged man in flannel pyjamas and an old\\nN flannel dressing gown\\nN stands in front of the open refrigerator holding an open jar\\nN of orange juice. He tips the jar\\nN back to drink, his free hand holding a balled-up towel to the\\nN back of his neck\\nN LARRY stares at him.\\nT FADE OUT\\nS BLEGEN HALL\\nN LARRY enters the departmental office. His eyes are red-rimmed\\nN and dark-bagged. He has\\nN beard stubble.\\nN The department's secretary wheels her castored chair away from\\nN her typing.\\nC SECRETARY\\nD Messages, Professor Gopnik.\\nN He takes the two phone messages.\\nC HIS OFFICE\\nN LARRY looks at the messages:\\nN WHILE YOU WERE OUT Dick Dutton\\nN OF Columbia Record Club\\nD CALLED.\\nN REGARDING: \\\"2d attempt. Please call.\\\"\\nN WHILE YOU WERE OUT Sy Ableman\\nD CALLED.\\nN REGARDING \\\"Let's have a good talk.\\\"\\nN A knock brings his look up.\\nC LARRY\\nD Yes-thanks for coming, CLIVE.\\nN CLIVE Park enters the office.\\nO 32\\nN . Have a seat.\\nN LARRY uses a key to open the top left desk drawer. He takes out\\nN the envelope.\\nN We had, I think, a good talk, the other day, but you left\\nN something that-\\nC CLIVE\\nD I didn't leave it.\\nC LARRY\\nD Well--you don't even know what I was going to say.\\nC CLIVE\\nD I didn't leave anything. I'm not missing anything. I know\\nD where everything is.\\nN LARRY looks at him, trying to formulate a thought.\\nC LARRY\\nD Well... then, CLIVE, where did this come from?\\nN He waves the envelope.\\nD . This is here, isn't it?\\nN CLIVE looks at it gravely.\\nC CLIVE\\nD Yes, sir. That is there.\\nC LARRY\\nD This is not nothing, this is something.\\nC CLIVE\\nD Yes sir. That is something.\\nD A beat.\\nD . What is it.\\nC LARRY\\nD You know what it is! You know what it is! I believe. And\\nC 33\\nD you know I can't keep it, CLIVE.\\nC CLIVE\\nD Of course, sir.\\nC LARRY\\nD I'll have to pass it on to Professor Finkle, along with my\\nD suspicions about where it came from. Actions have\\nD consequences.\\nC CLIVE\\nD Yes. Often.\\nC LARRY\\nD Always! Actions always have consequences!\\nN He pounds the desk for emphasis.\\nD In this office, actions have consequences!\\nC CLIVE\\nD Yes sir.\\nC LARRY\\nD Not just physics. Morally.\\nC CLIVE\\nD Yes.\\nC LARRY\\nD And we both know about your actions.\\nC CLIVE\\nD No sir. I know about my actions.\\nC LARRY\\nD I can interpret, CLIVE. I know what you meant me to\\nD understand.\\nC CLIVE\\nD Meer sir my sir.\\nN LARRY cocks his head.\\nO 34\\nC LARRY\\nD . Meer sir my sir?\\nC CLIVE\\nE (careful enunciation)\\nD Mere... surmise. Sir.\\nN He gravely shakes his head.\\nN . Very uncertain.\\nT CLOSE ON A TONE ARM\\nN A hand lays it onto a slowly spinning vinyl record.\\nN Through scratches and pops, a solo tenor starts a mournful Hebrew\\nN chant.\\nN Close on the sleeve:\\nN Rabbi Youssele Rosenblatt Chants Your Haftorah Portion\\nS VOLUME 12\\nN Rabbi Youssele wears a caftan and a felt hat and has sad eyes.\\nN They peer out from the\\nN dark beard that covers most of the rest of his face like owl's\\nN eyes peering out of the\\nN woods.\\nN Wider, on DANNY, in his bedroom, evening. He lifts the tone arm\\nN on the portable\\nS turntable.\\nN He chants the passage.\\nN He drops the tone arm at the same place; Rabbi Youssele chants\\nN the passage again.\\nN DANNY listens, eyes narrowed. He lifts the tone arm and chants\\nN the passage again.\\nN He replays the passage again; before he can lift the tone arm\\nN to echo it his door bursts\\nN open. Rabbi Youssele continues to chant.\\nO 35\\nC SARAH\\nD You little brat fucker! You snuck twenty bucks out of my\\nD drawer!\\nC DANNY\\nD Studying torah! Asshole!\\nC SARAH\\nD You little brat! I'm telling Dad!\\nC DANNY\\nD Oh yeah? You gonna tell him you've been sneaking it out\\nD of his wallet?\\nC SARAH\\nD All right, you know what I'm gonna do? You little brat? If\\nD you don't give it back?\\nN We hear the thunk of the front door opening. DANNY stands, calling:\\nC DANNY\\nD Dad?\\nS FOYER\\nN LARRY is entering with his briefcase. As he stows it in the foyer\\nN closet DANNY's voice\\nN continues, off:\\nC DANNY\\nD Dad, you gotta fix the aerial.\\nN Judith emerges from the kitchen.\\nC JUDITH\\nD Hello LARRY, have you thought about a lawyer?\\nC LARRY\\nD Honey, please!\\nN DANNY emerges from the hall.\\nC DANNY\\nC 36\\nD We're not getting channel four at all.\\nC LARRY\\nE (to Judith)\\nD Can we discuss it later?\\nC DANNY\\nD I can't get F Troop.\\nC JUDITH\\nD LARRY, the children know. Do you think this is some secret?\\nN Do you think this is something we're going to keep quiet?\\nN SARAH enters.\\nC SARAH\\nD Dad, Uncle Arthur is in the bathroom again! And I=m\\nD going to the hole at eight!\\nN She hits DANNY on the back of the head.\\nC DANNY\\nD Stop it!\\nC LARRY\\nD SARAH! What's going on!\\nC DANNY\\nD She keeps doing that!\\nO LATER\\nN LARRY sits in a reclining chair in the living room, head back,\\nN listening to Sidor Belarsky on\\nN the hi-fi. On top of the music is a hissing-sucking sound. There\\nN is also the sound of a\\nN pencil busily scratching paper.\\nN We cut to its source: Uncle Arthur sits scribbling into a spiral\\nN notebook, his free hand\\nN holding the end of a length of surgical tubing against the back\\nN of his neck. The tube leads\\nN to a water-pik-like appliance on an end table next to him-the\\nD source of the sucking\\nD sound.\\nN After a long beat of listening to the music, LARRY speaks into\\nN space:\\nO 37\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur?\\nD Uncle Arthur does not look up from his scribbling.\\nC Uncle Arthur\\nD Yes.\\nN LARRY continues to stare at the ceiling.\\nC LARRY\\nD What're you doing?\\nD Still without looking up:\\nC Uncle Arthur\\nD Working on the Mentaculus.\\nD Long beat. Music. Scribbling.\\nC LARRY\\nD Any luck, um, looking for an apartment?\\nD More scribbling.\\nC Uncle Arthur\\nD No.\\nN The doorbell chimes.\\nS FRONT DOOR\\nN LARRY enters, glances through the front door's head-height window,\\nN and-freezes, one\\nN hand arrested on the way to the doorknob.\\nN His point-of-view: framed by the window, yellowly lit by the\\nN stoop light, a human head.\\nN A middle-aged man, a few years older than LARRY. A fleshy face\\nN with droopy hangdog\\nN features, a five-o'clock shadow, and sad Harold Bloom eyes.\\nN LARRY opens the door.\\nO 38\\nC LARRY\\nD Sy.\\nN Sy, entering, thrusts out a hand. His voice vibrates with a warm,\\nN sad empathy:\\nC SY\\nD Good to see you, LARRY.\\nN He is a heavy-set man wearing a short-sleeved shirt that his\\nN belly tents out in front of\\nN him. In his left hand he holds a bottle of wine.\\nC LARRY\\nE (TIGHTLY)\\nD I'll get Judith.\\nC SY\\nD No, actually LARRY, I'm here to see you, if I might.\\nN He shakes his head.\\nD . Such a thing. Such a thing.\\nC LARRY\\nD Shall we go in the...\\nN He is leading him into the kitchen but Sy, oblivious to surroundings,\\nN plows on with the\\nN conversation, arresting both men in the narrow space between\\nS kitchen sink and stove, and\\nN invading LARRY's space.\\nC SY\\nD You know, LARRY-how we handle ourselves, in this\\nD situation-it's so impawtant.\\nC LARRY\\nD Uh-huh.\\nC SY\\nD Absolutely. Judith told me that she broke the news to you.\\nD She said you were very adult.\\nC LARRY\\nD Did she.\\nO 39\\nC SY\\nD Absolutely. The respect she has for you.\\nC LARRY\\nD Yes?\\nC SY\\nD Absolutely. But the children, LARRY. The children.\\nN He shakes his head.\\nD . The most impawtant.\\nC LARRY\\nD Well, I guess...\\nC SY\\nD Of coss. And Judith says they're handling it so well. A\\nD tribute to you. Do you drink wine? Because this is an\\nD incredible bottle. This is not Mogen David. This is a wine,\\nD LARRY. A bawdeaux.\\nC LARRY\\nD You know, Sy-\\nC SY\\nD Open it-let it breathe. Ten minutes. Letting it breathe, so\\nD impawtant.\\nC LARRY\\nD Thanks, Sy, but I'm not-\\nC SY\\nD I insist! No reason for discumfit. I'll be uncumftable if\\nD you don't take it. These are signs and tokens, LARRY.\\nC LARRY\\nD I'm just-I'm not ungrateful, I'm, I just don't know a lot\\nD about wine and, given our respective, you know-\\nN He is startled when Sy abruptly hugs him.\\nC SY\\nO 40\\nD S' okay.\\nN He finishes the hug off with a couple of thumps on the back.\\nN S'okay. Wuhgonnabe fine.\\nN SKEWED ANGLE ON PARKING LOT\\nN We are dutch on a slit of a view through a cracked-open frosted\\nN window: the Hebrew\\nS school parking lot.\\nN The last couple of busses filled with students are rolling out\\nN of the lot. It is late\\nS afternoon.\\nN A reverse shows DANNY in a stall, standing on a closed toilet,\\nN angling his head to peer out\\nN the bathroom window opened at the top.\\nN The bathroom outside the stall: Ronnie Nudell leans against a\\nN sink waiting, sucking a\\nN long draw from a joint.\\nN DANNY emerges from the stall. Ronnie Nudell offers the joint.\\nC Ronnie Nudell\\nD Want some of this fucker?\\nS HALLWAY\\nN The bathroom door cracks open in the foreground. DANNY peeks\\nN out.\\nN His point-of-view: the empty hallway ending in a T with another\\nS hallway. A janitor\\nN crosses, pushing a broom down the far hallway. He disappears.\\nN His echoing footsteps\\nN recede.\\nN DANNY and Ronny emerge from the bathroom.\\nN RABBI MINDA\\nN The photo-portrait on the wall of Mar Turchik's office lit by\\nS late-day sun.\\nN We hear a scraping sound.\\nO 41\\nN Wider: Ronnie Nudell looks over DANNY's shoulder as DANNY, hunched\\nS at Mar Turchik's\\nN desk, fishes the end of a bent hanger into the keyhole on the\\nN top left drawer. After a beat,\\nN the hanger turns.\\nN They open the drawer. In it: squirt guns, marbles set to rolling\\nN by the opening of the\\nN drawer, a comic book, a Playboy magazine, a slingshot, a small\\nN bundle of firecrackers.\\nN Hands rifle the gewgaws: no radio.\\nC Ronnie Nudell\\nD Fuck.\\nS SANCTUARY\\nN We are behind the two boys who sit side by side on the last pew,\\nN staring at the front of\\nN the empty sanctuary. Its stained glass windows further weaken\\nS the late-afternoon light.\\nN In deference to the location, the boys wear yarmulkas.\\nN A long hold on their still backs.\\nN At length, some movement in DANNY's back, his head dips, and\\nN we hear him sucking on\\nN the joint. He holds it, exhales, and passes it wordlessly to\\nN Ronnie Nudell.\\nS SUBURBAN STREET\\nN We are pulling DANNY as he walks along the street, eyes red-rimmed,\\nN still wearing his\\nN yarmulka. It is dusk.\\nN After a few beats of walking, the front door of a house just\\nN behind DANNY opens. A\\nN husky, shaggy-haired youth emerges on the run.\\nN The sound has alerted DANNY. Seeing Mike Fagle, he too begins\\nN to run. He reaches up\\nN and grabs his yarmulka and clutches it in one of his pumping\\nN fists.\\nN Pursued and pursuer both run wordlessly, panting, feet pounding.\\nN Mike Fagle is closing. But DANNY is already cutting across the\\nS Brandt's front yard,\\nN approaching his own. He plunges into the house and slams the\\nN door.\\nN Mike Fagle draws up, panting, gazing hungrily at the house.\\nO 42\\nN Lights are on inside. The house is a warm yellow citadel in the\\nN dusk.\\nN After a beat we hear, faint and dulled, the Jefferson Airplane.\\nN Mike Fagle slinks away.\\nN PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS\\nN A shockingly blue sky with picture-perfect clouds hanging in\\nN it.\\nN After a beat the top of an aluminum extension ladder swings in\\nN from the bottom of the\\nN frame and comes toward us.\\nN We cut to a side angle as the ladder clunk against a roof.\\nN It starts vibrating to the rhythmic clung of someone climbing.\\nN Hands enter. LARRY's head enters.\\nN He climbs onto the roof.\\nN He takes a couple steps away from the edge and stands tentatively,\\nN making sure of his\\nN balance. He looks around.\\nN His point-of-view towards the front. An unfamiliarly high perspective\\nN on the street and\\nN the neighboring houses, almost maplike. Very peaceful. Wind rhythmically,\\nN gently\\nN waves the trees.\\nN LARRY gingerly walks up to the aerial at the peak of the roof.\\nN We are hearing a rhythmic\\nN popping noise.\\nN LARRY reaches the peak and straddles it. He looks down at the\\nN back yard.\\nN MITCH\\nD Ow.\\nN Foreshortened Gar Brandt and Mitch are playing catch in their\\nN back yard. With each toss\\nN the ball pops, alternately in father's mitt and son's.\\nN Precariously balanced, LARRY reaches out for the aerial. He tentatively\\nN touches it. He\\nN grasps it. He twists the aerial.\\nO 43\\nN Something strange: as it rotates the aerial creaks-a high whine\\nN as pure as the hum\\nN sounded from the rim of a wineglass.\\nN MITCH\\nD Ow.\\nN Faintly, under the wineglass sound, and clouded by static, a\\nN high, ringing tenor sings in\\nN an unfamiliar modality. Cantorial music.\\nN LARRY drops his hand. Inertia keeps the aerial rotating slowly\\nN til it dies, the sound drifting\\nN away into the sybillant shushing of trees.\\nN LARRY reaches out again to turn the aerial. The same crystal\\nN hum... cantorial singing...\\nN and now, layering in, the theme from F Troop.\\nN Music. Crystal hum. Wind.\\nN MITCH\\nN Ow.\\nN LARRY's look travels: his point-of-view pans slowly off the steep\\nN angle of father and son\\nN playing catch, travels across his own backyard, and brings in\\nN the white fence that\\nN encloses the patio of the neighbor on the other side.\\nN Gar (off)\\nD Good toss, Mitch.\\nN On the enclosed patio a woman reclines on a lawn chaise of nylon\\nN bands woven over an\\nN aluminum frame. She is on her back, eyes closed against the sun.\\nN She is naked.\\nC Mitch (off)\\nD Ow.\\nN LARRY reacts to the naked woman: startled at first, he moves\\nN to hide behind the peak of the\\nN roof. But as he realizes that the sun keeps the woman's eyes\\nN closed he relaxes, continu-\\nN ing to stare.\\nN She is attractive. Not young, not old: LARRY's age. Peaceful.\\nN After a still beat one of her hands gropes blindly to the side.\\nN It finds an ashtray on the\\nN table next to her and takes from it a pluming cigarette. The\\nN woman takes a puff and\\nN replaces it.\\nO 44\\nE Mitch (off)\\nD Ow.\\nS F Troop. Cantorial singing.\\nN Blue sky and white puffy clouds.\\nN The sound of a pencil scratching against paper.\\nN NOTEBOOK\\nN A pencil scratches equations into a lamplit spiral notebook.\\nN Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut. So does the spluttering suck-sound\\nN of Uncle Arthur's\\nS evacuator.\\nN Wider on Uncle Arthur, in his pyjamas, propped up on the narrow\\nN fold-out sofa, writing\\nN with one hand as he holds the evacuator hose to his neck with\\nN the other.\\nN Squeezed into the living room next to the fold-out sofa is a\\nN camp cot of plaid-patterned\\nN nylon stretched over an aluminum frame. On the camp cot is LARRY,\\nN lying half-in, half-\\nN out of a rumpled sleeping bag. He stares at the ceiling, a damp\\nN washcloth pressed against\\nN his forehead. His face is flaming red.\\nN Arthur speaks absently as he scribbles:\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Will you read this? Tell me what you think?\\nN LARRY continues to stare at the ceiling.\\nC LARRY\\nD Okay.\\nN Uncle Arthur glances up from the notebook, focuses on LARRY.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Boy. You should've worn a hat.\\nD LATER\\nO 45\\nN The lights are out. Very quiet. Uncle Arthur lightly snores.\\nN LARRY still stares at the ceiling. He shifts his weight. The\\nN aluminum frame of the cot\\nN squeaks. He shifts again. Another creak.\\nN LARRY fishes his watch from the jumble of clothes on the floor:\\nN 4:50.\\nS KITCHEN\\nN LARRY, in his underwear, spoons ground coffee into the percolator.\\nN Uncle Arthur snores\\nN softly on in the other room.\\nN From outside, a dull thunk.\\nN LARRY pulls back a curtain.\\nN Next door, Gar Brandt is going down the walk, wearing camouflage\\nN togs and camo billed\\nN cap, a rifle bag slung over his shoulder. He is carrying an ice\\nN chest, its contents clicking\\nN and sloshing.\\nN The boy Mitch, also wearing camo clothes and cap and also with\\nN a rifle bag, has just\\nN closed the front door. He now lets the screen door swing shut\\nN behind him and follows his\\nN father down the walk to the car in the driveway.\\nN The twitter of early morning birds. Gar's voice, though not projected,\\nN stands out in the\\nS pre-dawn quiet:\\nM GAR\\nN Let's see some hustle, Mitch.\\nT CLOSE ON THE NOTEBOOK\\nN Its top sheet, densely covered by equations, has a heading:\\nN The Mentaculus\\nS Compiled by Arthur Gopnik\\nN After a beat LARRY's hand enters to turn the page. The second\\nN page is also densely\\nN covered with equations.\\nO 46\\nC VOICE\\nC LARRY?\\nN This brings LARRY's look up from the Mentaculus. We are in LARRY's\\nN office. Standing in\\nN the office doorway is Arlen Finkle.\\nC LARRY\\nD Hi Arlen.\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD LARRY, I feel that, as head of the tenure committee I should\\nD tell you this, though it should be no cause for concern. You\\nD should not be at all worried.\\nN LARRY waits for more. Arlen seems to need a prompt.\\nC LARRY\\nD Okay.\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD I feel I should mention it even though we won't give this\\nD any weight at all in considering whether to grant you\\nD tenure, so, I repeat no cause for concern.\\nC LARRY\\nD Okay, Arlen. Give what any weight?\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD We have received some letters, uh... denigrating you, and,\\nD well, urging that we not grant you tenure.\\nC LARRY\\nD From who?\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD They're anonymous. And so of course we dismiss them\\nD completely.\\nC LARRY\\nD Well... well... what do they say?\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD They make allegations, not even allegations, assertions, but\\nC 47\\nD I'm not really... while we give them no credence, LARRY,\\nD I'm not supposed to deal in any specifics about the\\nD committee's deliberations.\\nC LARRY\\nD But... I think you're saying, these won't play any part in\\nD your deliberations.\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD None at all.\\nC LARRY\\nD Um, so what are they...\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD Moral turpitude. You could say.\\nC LARRY\\nD Uh-huh. Can I ask, are they, are they-idiomatic?\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD I, uh...\\nC LARRY\\nD The reason I ask, I have a Korean student, South Korean,\\nD disgruntled South Korean, and I meant to talk to you about\\nD this, actually, he-\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD No. No, the letters are competently-even eloquently\\nD written. A native English-speaker. No question about\\nD that.\\nC LARRY\\nD Uh-huh.\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD But I reiterate this, LARRY: no cause for concern. I only\\nD speak because I would have felt odd concealing it.\\nC LARRY\\nD Yes, okay, thank you Arlen.\\nO 48\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD Best to Judith.\\nN LARRY answers with a wan smile. He looks down at the Mentaculus.\\nN HEBREW SCHOOL EXTERIOR\\nN Day. Somewhere inside the school a bell rings. Its doors swing\\nN open and children\\nN emerge.\\nN Our angle is down a line of school busses, each with the the\\nN same stenciled Hebrew\\nN lettering, waiting to ferry the children home.\\nN We are tracking toward the busses to steepen the rake. As children\\nN sort themselves out\\nN and climb into their respective vehicles, the track brings the\\nS nearest bus into the fore-\\nN ground. It noisily idles with its signature squeaks and stress\\nN sounds, its low coughing\\nN engine ominously rumbling. Children start climbing on.\\nS MINUTES LATER\\nN Inside the bus, now moving. Engine noise bangs in louder and\\nN air roars in through open\\nN windows.\\nN We are on the driver, a sallow man in a short-sleeved white shirt\\nN with earlocks and a\\nN yarmulke. He pitches about, stoically wrestling with the wheel\\nN and gear shift as the\\nD vehicle bucks.\\nN The pitching children. Somewhere, Jefferson Airplane plays.\\nC DANNY\\nD I gotta get my radio back.\\nC Ronnie Nudell\\nD Maybe the fucker lodged it up his fucking asshole.\\nC DANNY\\nD I gotta get it back. Or Mike Fagle's gonna pound the crap\\nD out of me.\\nC Ronnie Nudell\\nO 49\\nN Way up his asshole.\\nC DANNY\\nD And I'll still have to get my sister the money back or she's\\nD gonna break four of my records. Twenty bucks, four\\nD records.\\nC Howard Altar\\nD How do you buy all those records. Where do you get your\\nD funds.\\nC CLOSE ON LARRY\\nN Standing in his yard. His eyes are darkly pouched. He is staring\\nN at something, it seems\\nN in distress. We hear a fluttering sound.\\nN His point-of-view: stakes are set out in the Brandts' yard. Red\\nN ribbon connecting them\\nN outlines a projection from the side of the house. The loose ends\\nN of the ribbon flutter in\\nN the breeze.\\nN Engine noise brings LARRY's look around. A car is arriving.\\nN It is the Brandts' car, oddly burdened. As it pulls into their\\nN driveway we see that there is\\nN a four-point stag strapped to the hood, its head lolling over\\nN the grille.\\nN Gar and Mitch get out of the car in their hunting fatigues. Blood\\nN is smeared on Gar's\\nN shirt.\\nM GAR\\nD Go scrub up, Mitch.\\nC LARRY\\nD Uh, good afternoon.\\nN This brings Gar's look around. Apparently he is unused to talking\\nN with his neighbor.\\nN There is a short beat before his response.\\nM GAR\\nS Afternoon.\\nN In the background of his angle is the dead buck, staring off\\nN through sightless eyes.\\nO 50\\nC LARRY\\nE (LAMELY)\\nD . Been hunting?\\nM GAR\\nD Yep.\\nC LARRY\\nD Is that a, uh...\\nN He is indicating the staked area.

Oh, great, then I'll bring\\nN DANNY...\\nT LAKE NOKOMIS\\nN The beach: families are crowded onto the small beach of a freshwater\\nS lake, children\\nN cavorting, adults lounging, much sun, few umbrellas. Red floats\\nN connected by red nylon\\nN rope define a swimming area; beyond it people dive from an anchored\\nN raft.\\nN Splashing and children's laughter slap off the surface of the\\nN lake.\\nC WOODS\\nN Above the lake. The beach noise has some distance. It also has\\nN a faintly bizarre canyon\\nN echo. There is a present, sybillant shushing of breeze in the\\nN trees.\\nN It is dark here with intense hot spots where sun sifts through\\nN the leaf cover. We are close\\nN on DANNY, who sits very still, leaning back against a tree trunk.\\nO 63\\nN After a very long beat he slowly exhales, a small amount of smoke\\nN feathering out with his\\nN breath.\\nC VOICE\\nD Gimme that fucker.\\nN DANNY passes the joint to Ronnie Nudell, who sits opposite.\\nS PICNIC AREA\\nN On a woodless rise above the lake. Each of the separate picnic\\nN areas consist of a redwood\\nN table and benches placed next to a firepit.\\nN Here in the sun both LARRY and Mel Nudell, a man slightly older\\nN than LARRY, glisten with\\nN sweat. Mel, in the background, bounces a bag of charcoal briquettes\\nN to spill some into\\nN the firepit. LARRY sits at the table in the foreground with Mimi\\nN Nudell who alone seems\\nN unaffected by the heat-or by anything else in the physical environment.\\nN Her pale,\\nN gravely composed Giacometti face is shaded by a large-brimmed\\nN hat.\\nC LARRY\\nD No. Almost a year and a half since Touche Ross let him\\nD go. He's very good with numbers. I think his, his social\\nD skills have held him back.\\nC MIMI\\nD Such a sweet man though.\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur has a good heart. And he never complains, unlike\\nD me. Sometimes I don't give him enough credit.\\nC MIMI\\nD He tried to tell me about this thing he's working on, this,\\nD um...\\nC LARRY\\nD The Mentaculus? He says it's a, uh. a probability map.\\nD Of the universe. He asked if I could help him publish it.\\nD Um, it was a little hard for me to evaluate.\\nO 64\\nN A beat.\\nC MIMI\\nD Does he go out socially at all?\\nC LARRY\\nD He tries. He's been going to the singles mixers at Hillel\\nD House.-Well, I should talk, I'm not doing any better.\\nC MIMI\\nD How is Judith?\\nC LARRY\\nD Fine. She's fine. I'm the odd man out.\\nN Mimi smiles.\\nC MIMI\\nD Sometimes these things just aren't meant to be. And it can\\nD take a while before you feel what was always there, for\\nD better or worse.\\nC LARRY\\nD I never felt it! It was a bolt from the blue! What does that\\nD mean! Everything that I thought was one way turns out to\\nD be another!\\nC MIMI\\nD Then-it's an opportunity to learn how things really are.\\nN LARRY broods. Mimi softens.\\nN . I'm sorry-I don't mean to sound glib. It's not always\\nN easy, deciphering what God is trying to tell you.\\nC LARRY\\nD I'll say.\\nC MIMI\\nD But it's not something you have to figure out all by your-\\nD self. We're Jews, we have that well of tradition to draw on,\\nD to help us understand.

She strokes his hand,\\nN still looking at LARRY.\\nC LARRY\\nD What's the rabbi gonna tell me?\\nC MIMI\\nD If I knew I'd be the rabbi.\\nN He looks at her glumly. She laughs.\\nN .

She's usually right about these\\nD things.\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD Mm-hm.\\nC LARRY\\nD I feel so... addled.\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD Yes, I can see.\\nC LARRY\\nD I was hoping that... Rabbi Nachtner...\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD That he would... yes?\\nO 68\\nC LARRY\\nD Well, with the benefit of his life experience... no\\nD OFFENSE-\\nN Rabbi Scott chuckles.\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD No, of course not. I am the junior rabbi. And it's true, the\\nD point-of-view of somebody who's older and perhaps had\\nD similar problems might be more valid. And you should see\\nD the senior rabbi as well, by all means. Or even Minda if\\nD you can get in, he's quite busy. But maybe-can I share\\nD something with you? Because I too have had the feeling of\\nD losing track of Hashem, which is the problem here. I too\\nD have forgotten how to see Him in the world. And when\\nD that happens you think, well, if I can't see Him, He isn't\\nD there any more, He's gone. But that's not the case. You\\nD just need to remember how to see Him. Am I right?\\nN He rises and goes to the window.\\nD I mean, the parking lot here. Not much to see.\\nN It is a different angle on the same parking lot we saw from the\\nC Hebrew school window.\\nD But if you imagine yourself a visitor, somebody who\\nD isn't familiar with these... autos and such... somebody\\nN still with a capacity for wonder... Someone with a fresh...\\nN perspective. That's what it is, LARRY.\\nC LARRY\\nD Um...\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD Because with the right perspective you can see Hashem,\\nD you know, reaching into the world. He is in the world, not\\nD just in shul. It souunds to me like you're looking at the\\nD world, looking at your wife, through tired eyes. It sounds\\nD like she's become a sort of... thing... a problem... a\\nD thing...\\nC LARRY\\nD Well, she's, she's seeing Sy Ableman.\\nO 69\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD Oh.\\nC LARRY\\nD She's, they're planning, that's why they want the Gett.\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD Oh. I'm sorry.\\nC LARRY\\nD It was his idea.\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD Well, they do need a Gett to remarry in the faith. But this\\nD is life. For you too. You can't cut yourself off from the\\nD mystical or you'll be-you'll remain-completely lost.\\nD You have to see these things as expressions of God's will.\\nD You don't have to like it, of course.\\nC LARRY\\nD The boss isn't always right, but he's always the boss.\\nC Rabbi Scott\\nD Ha-ha-ha! That's right, things aren't so bad. Look at the\\nS parking lot, LARRY.\\nN Rabbi Scott gazes out, marveling.\\nN . Just look at that parking lot.\\nS EXTERIOR: GOPNIK HOUSE\\nN Our low angle looks across the lawn toward the front of the house.\\nN Someone's pounding\\nN footsteps approach and his feet enter just off the lens and he\\nN quickly recedes, cropping in\\nN as he races up to the house: DANNY.\\nN A beat later pursuing feet enter, slowing-for DANNY is already\\nN mounting the front\\nN stoop.

He carries the mold\\nN over to a drying table.\\nN Kraus is twisted over the side of the chair spitting into the\\nN water-swirled spit-sink.\\nN . Well, the mold dries and Lee is examining it one day\\nO 83\\nN before fabricating an appliance...\\nN Another day: Dr. Sussman is sitting at his desk examining the\\nN lower mold.

He notices something unusual.\\nN Sussman reaches up for the loupe attached to his eyeglasses.\\nN There seems to be something engraved on the inside of the\\nN patient's lower incisors...\\nN He flips down the loupe.

What is that-tiranu\\nD linoshets? \\\"Help me\\\"? Is that what it says? Or is it a\\nN name? It's not Kraus's name.\\nN Sussman flips the loupe away and looks off, haunted. He rises.\\nN He checks the mold, just to be sure. Oh, it's there all\\nO 84\\nD right...\\nN A dental mirror is dipped into the horse-shoe-shaped hardened\\nN paste of the mold.

No.\\nO 85\\nN Sussman is in bed, pyjamas buttoned to the neck, staring at the\\nN ceiling.\\nN What does it mean? Is it a message for him, for Sussman?\\nN And if so, from whom? Does Sussman know? Sussman\\nN doesn't know.\\nN Back in the dental office Sussman pulls boxes containing other\\nN molds off the shelf.\\nN Sussman looks at the molds of his other patients, goy and\\nN Jew alike, seeking other messages. He finds none. He\\nN looks in his own mouth...\\nN Close on Sussman in front of a mirror straining to see the reflection\\nN of a reflection of the\\nN dental mirror he holds in his own mouth.\\nN . Nothing. His wife's mouth...\\nN Sussman's wife lies asleep on her back, her mouth open, snoring\\nN softly. Sussman, in\\nN pyjamas but with his glasses on and loupe in place, lies over\\nN her in bed, supporting\\nN himself with one arm thrown across her body. He leans awkwardly\\nN in, carefully\\nN lowering a dental mirror into his wife's open mouth.\\nN . Nothing. It is a singular event. A mystery.\\nN The Jefferson Airplane guitar solo is heating up.\\nN But Sussman is an educated man. Not the world's greatest\\nN sage, maybe, no Rabbi Minda, but he knows a thing or two\\nN from the Zohar and the Caballah. He knows every Hebrew\\nN letter has its numeric equivalent.\\nN Sussman, still in his pyjamas is sitting at the kitchen table\\nN scribbling on a tablet of lined\\nD paper.\\nN Close on the paper: the Hebrew letters have been transcribed\\nO into their numeric\\nO EQUIVALENTS:\\nO 496-2428\\nN Nachtner continues in voice-over:\\nO 86\\nS Seven digits-a phone number maybe?\\nN Sussman reaches for the phone.

In Bloomington.\\nS Thanks so much.\\nN The manager, puzzled, hangs up.\\nN Sussman thinks, am I supposed to go to the Red Owl, to\\nN receive a further sign? He goes...\\nN In the parking lot of the Red Owl Sussman, wearing a short-brimmed\\nN fedora, emerges\\nN from his car. It is an unremarkable grocery store in a suburban\\nS mall.\\nN It's a Red Owl.\\nN Inside Sussman, in his fedora, gazes around.\\nN Groceries.

Could be a nun sofit... Or maybe not...\\nN The parking lot again: Sussman gets back in his car.\\nC 87\\nN Sussman goes home. What does it mean? He has to find\\nN out, if he's ever to sleep again.\\nN Sussman again, in pyjamas buttoned to the neck, lies in his bed\\nN staring at the ceiling.\\nN He goes to see the Rabbi, Nachtner. He comes in and sits\\nN right where you're sitting now.\\nN Sussman is indeed sitting across from Rabbi Nachtner, just where\\nN we've seen LARRY\\nD sitting.\\nN What does it mean, Rabbi? Is it a sign from Hashem?\\nN \\\"Help me.\\\" I, Sussman, should be doing something to help\\nN this goy? Doing what? The teeth don't say. I should know\\nD without asking?

He went back to work.\\nD For a while he checked every patient's teeth for new\\nD messages; didn't see any; in time, he found he'd stopped\\nD checking.\\nD Sussman, at home, chats with his wife over dinner.\\nD . These questions that are bothering you, LARRY-maybe\\nD they're like a toothache. We feel them for a while, then\\nD they go away.\\nN Sussman lies in bed sleeping, smiling, an arm thrown across his\\nN wife.\\nC LARRY\\nD Dissatisfied.\\nC LARRY\\nD I don't want it to just go away! I want an answer!\\nC Rabbi Nachtner\\nD The answer! Sure! We all want the answer! But Hashem\\nD doesn't owe us the answer, LARRY. Hashem doesn't owe us\\nD anything. The obligation runs the other way.\\nC LARRY\\nD Why does he make us feel the questions if he's not gonna\\nD give us any answers?\\nN Rabbi Nachtner smiles at LARRY for a beat.\\nO 90\\nC Rabbi Nachtner\\nD He hasn't told me.\\nN LARRY rubs his face, frustrated.\\nN A last question occurs to him:\\nC LARRY\\nD And what happened to the goy?\\nN Rabbi Nachtner's forebearing smile fades into puzzlement.\\nC Rabbi Nachtner\\nD The goy? Who cares?\\nS EXTERIOR: THE SYNAGOGUE\\nN The modern synagogue grafted onto a patch of prairie.\\nN An echoing voice rings out:\\nC VOICE\\nD Sy Ableman was a serious man!\\nC RABBI NACHTNER\\nN In close-up he gazes around, weighing the effect of the words\\nD just delivered.\\nN After a long beat during which he seeks to establish eye contact\\nN with as much of his\\nN audience as possible:\\nC Rabbi Nachtner\\nD . Sy Ableman was a man devoted to his community...\\nN Wider shows Rabbi Nachtner up on the bema.

She sits\\nN a few rows ahead looking\\nN grimly up at the rabbi.\\nD . and to his duty, as he saw it. Where does such a man\\nD go? A tzadik-who knows, maybe even a lamid vovnik-a\\nD man beloved by all, a man who despised the frivolous?\\nD Could such a serious man... simply... disappear?\\nD The words echo.\\nN Again the rabbi gazes around, as if awaiting answer.\\nN THEN:\\nN . We speak of L'olam ha-ba, the World to Come. Not\\nN heaven. Not what the gentiles think of as afterlife.\\nN \\\"L'olam ha-ba.\\\" What is L'olam ha-ba? Where is L'olam\\nN ha-ba? Well: it is not a geoaraphic place, certainly.\\nN Like-Canada.\\nN Murmured chuckles from the congregation.\\nN Nor is it the eretz zavat chalav ood'vash-the land flowing\\nD with milk and honey, for we are not promised a personal\\nN reward, a gold star, a first-class VIP lounge where we get\\nN milk and cookies to eternity!\\nN More chuckles.\\nN L'olam ha-ba... is in the bosom of Abraham. L'olam ba-\\nN ba is in the soul of this community which nurtured Sy\\nN Ableman and to which Sy Ableman now returns. That's\\nN right, he returns. Because he still inspires us Ableman\\nN returns. Because his memory instructs us Ableman\\nN returns. Because his thoughts illuminate our days and ways\\nN Sy Ableman returns. The frivolous man may vanish\\nN without a ripple but Sy Ableman? Sy Ableman was a\\nD serious man...\\nO 92\\nN A sob echoes through the sanctuary.\\nN LARRY looks at Judith, who stifles further sobs with a handkerchief.\\nN . As you know, the mourner's kaddish does not mention\\nN the dead. It praises Hashem; it praises what abides. And\\nN Sy Ableman, whose spirit will continue to assist us in\\nN tikkun olam, is with us even now, a serious man who would\\nN say as we now say Yiskadal v'yiskadash sh'may rabah...\\nN The congregation begins to chant along but it and Judith's weeping\\nN are cut off by:\\nN A HAND RAPPING AT A DOOR\\nN The front door to the Gopnik home.\\nN LARRY, still in his suit from shul and wearing a yarmulka, opens\\nN the door. He recoils in\\nN surprise edged with fear.\\nN Reverse: two uniformed policemen.\\nS COP 1\\nD Arthur Gopnik?\\nN LARRY is momentarily dumb. Inside the house we can see a corner\\nN of a card table set up in\\nN the living room with food laid out on it. SARAH sits with her\\nN back to us, head wrapped by\\nN a towel-turban. Arthur, on the far side of the table, his balding\\nN head domed by a yarmul-\\nN ka, half-leans out so that he may sneak looks toward the men\\nN at the door without totally\\nN revealing himself. From somewhere down the hall come Judith's\\nN muffled sobs.\\nD . Are you Arthur Gopnik?\\nC LARRY\\nD I'm...

Although it was, in a way.\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD It's all right, LARRY. Believe me.\\nN LARRY calms somewhat.\\nC LARRY\\nD . Okay.\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD Okay. Okay. We, uh, we decide on Wednesday, so if\\nD there's anything you want to submit in support of your\\nD tenure application, we should have it by then. That's all.\\nC LARRY\\nO 103\\nD Submit. What. What do you-\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD Well. Anything. Published work. Anything else you've\\nD done outside of the institution. Any work that we might not\\nD be aware of.\\nC LARRY\\nD I haven't done anything.\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD Uh-huh.\\nC LARRY\\nD I haven't published.\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD Uh-huh.\\nC LARRY\\nD Are you still getting those letters?\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD Uh-huh.\\nC LARRY\\nD Those anonymous-\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD Yes, I know. Yes.\\nN A beat. LARRY nods.\\nC LARRY\\nD Okay. Okay. Wednesday.\\nC Arlen Finkle\\nD Okay. Don't worry. Doing nothing is not bad. Ipso facto.\\nC LARRY\\nD Sure.\\nO 104\\nS CLASSROOM\\nN We are close over LARRY's shoulder as he scribbles symbols onto\\nN the chalkboard.\\nC LARRY\\nD . and that means... so that... from which we derive...\\nN His glances back toward the class show that he is wearier, baggier-eyed,\\nN more haggard\\nN than ever. There is also something odd about his posture.\\nN He writes smaller and smaller so as to finish before hitting\\nN the right edge of the\\nC chalkboard.\\nD . and also.. which lets us... and...\\nN Wider as he finishes and straightens up, revealing that he has\\nN been stooping to write\\nN across the very bottom of the board.\\nN The equation covers every inch of the classroom-wide three-paneled\\nN chalkboard. LARRY\\nN is an off balance figure at the right edge of frame.\\nN Reverse on the class: staring.\\nD Okay?\\nN LARRY claps chalk dust from his hands.\\nN . The Uncertainty Principle. It proves we can't ever\\nN really know... what's going on.\\nN A bell sounds. The students start to shake off their stupor and\\nN rise. LARRY projects over\\nC the wallah:\\nD . So it shouldn't bother you. Not being able to figure\\nD anything out. Although you will be responsible for this on\\nD the mid-term.\\nN The thinning crowd gradually reveals one person still seated:\\nC Sy Ableman.\\nN He wears a prayer shawl and yarmulka.\\nO 105\\nN LARRY does not seem surprised to see him.\\nD . Did you follow that?\\nC Sy Ableman\\nD Of coss. Except that I know what's going on. How do you\\nD explain.\\nC LARRY\\nD Well, it might be that, in, you know, in L'olam ha-bah-\\nC Sy Ableman\\nD Excuse me. Not the issue. In this world, LARRY.\\nN He nods at the chalkboard.\\nN . I'll concede that it's subtle. It's clevva. But at the end\\nN of the day, is it convincing?\\nC LARRY\\nD Well-yes it's convincing. It's a proof. It's mathematics.\\nC Sy Ableman\\nD Excuse me, LARRY. Mathematics. Is the art of the possible.\\nN LARRY's brow furrows.\\nC LARRY\\nD I don't think so. The art of the possible, that's... I can't\\nD remember... something else...\\nC Sy Ableman\\nD I'm a serious man, LARRY.\\nC LARRY\\nD I know that. So if I've got it wrong, what do I-\\nN Sy Ableman holds up one hand to silence him.\\nC Sy Ableman\\nD So simple, LARRY. See Minda.\\nO 106\\nC LARRY\\nD I know, I want to see Minda! I want to see Minda! They\\nD told me that oonh!\\nN Without our having seen him rise or cross the room Sy Ableman\\nN has body-slammed\\nN LARRY into the chalkboard. Now he grabs LARRY by the hair and\\nN whips his head against\\nN the equation. As he slams LARRY's head, again and again, the\\nN chalkboard chatters and the\\nN fringes on Sy's tallis dance.\\nC Sy Ableman\\nD See Minda! See Minda! I fucked your wife, LARRY! I\\nD seriously fucked her! That's what's going on! See Minda!\\nC LARRY\\nN Very close on his eyes as they open. His head is on a pillow.\\nN Dull early light. A hissing\\nN sound.\\nN LARRY looks blearily over.\\nN On the vanity table just outside the motel bathroom door sits\\nN Uncle Arthur's cyst\\nN evacuator. Its waggling hose snakes into the cracked bathroom\\nN door as the machine\\nN hisses.\\nC MEZUZA\\nD On a doorpost.\\nN A hand enters to knock. A long beat. The person knocking gives\\nN up and his footsteps\\nN start to go away just as the door opens to reveal an attractive\\nN woman the sunbathing\\nN neighbor, now wearing plaid shorts and a buttoned white blouse.\\nN Her point-of-view: LARRY, frozen halfway down the stoop, head\\nN turned back up toward\\nN the door.\\nC WOMAN\\nD Mr. Gopnik.\\nO 107\\nC LARRY\\nD Oh. Hello, Mrs. Samsky. I knocked, and then thought you\\nD weren't here. I, uh...\\nN Mrs. Samsky's voice is soft and breathy:\\nC Mrs. Samsky\\nD It just took me a second to get to the door. I was out back.\\nN LARRY stands nodding.\\nN He seems to need prompting. Mrs. Samsky does:\\nN . Can I help you? Wanna come in?\\nC LARRY\\nD No, I-\\nN One hand on the door, she steps back.\\nC Mrs. Samsky\\nD It's cooler.\\nC LARRY\\nD Oh. Okay. I just wanted to let you know...\\nN He is entering.\\nS INSIDE\\nN After the outside glare the house does indeed seem cooler. LARRY\\nN looks around the living\\nN room, dim but neat. Wavering light sifts through closed vertical\\nN blinds which drift and\\nN click over floor-vented air-conditioning.\\nN Mrs. Samsky closes the door, shutting out all sound from outside.\\nC LARRY\\nN I've noticed that Mr. Samsky isn't around, and I-\\nN Mrs. Samsky\\nN He travels.\\nO 108\\nC LARRY\\nD Uh-huh. Yeah, I never seem to see him, so I thought I\\nD should let you know, since you're somewhat new here, if\\nD you ever have, whatever, chores that you'd, um, or just help\\nD with something-I've decided to help others-you know,\\nD in a neighborly way...\\nN She gazes at him with the least hint of a smile and waits for\\nN the speech to dribble away to\\nN silence. In the ensuing beat, quiet except for the clicking of\\nN the blinds, she is perfectly\\nN still. Finally, only her mouth moves:\\nC Mrs. Samsky\\nD How thoughtful.\\nN LARRY shrugs off the compliment.\\nC LARRY\\nD Oh it's nothing. It's just good to know your neighbors.\\nD And to help. Help others. Although I don't care much for\\nD my neighbors on the other side, I must say.\\nN Mrs. Samsky lets another smiling silence pass before responding.\\nC Mrs. Samsky\\nD . Goys, aren't they?\\nC LARRY\\nD Mm. Very much so. Maybe it's not fair to judge; I have to\\nD admit I-\\nC Mrs. Samsky\\nD Won't you sit down?\\nC LARRY\\nD Oh! Um. Okay. Thank you.\\nC Mrs. Samsky\\nD Iced tea? I have some.\\nN She is already turning to the kitchen.\\nO 109\\nC LARRY\\nD Okay.. .\\nN He watches her and reacts to:\\nN The backs of her thighs. The flesh retains the broad cross-hatch\\nN of her lawn chair.\\nN She disappears into the kitchen, but calls out:\\nC Mrs. Samsky\\nD I don't see you around much, either.\\nC LARRY\\nD Yes. Actually I haven't been home a lot recently, I, uh, my\\nD wife and I are, uh, well, she's got me staying at the Jolly\\nD Roger, the little motel there on-\\nN Mrs. Samsky is reentering with two tall glasses of iced tea beaded\\nN with moisture. The\\nN click of the ice cubes joins the clicking of the blinds.\\nC Mrs. Samsky\\nD You're in the doghouse, huh?\\nN She hands him a glass as she sits on the couch next to him, not\\nN invasively close, one bare\\nN leg folded onto the couch, the other draped over it.\\nC LARRY\\nD Yeah, that's an understatement I guess, I -thank you-I,\\nD UH-\\nC Mrs. Samsky\\nD Do you take advantage of the new freedoms?\\nN LARRY stares at her. Mrs. Samsky gazes back. Her look displays\\nN equanimity; his, not.\\nO FINALLY:\\nC LARRY\\nD . What do you mean.\\nN Her look holds for one more beat and then she swivels and opens\\nN the drawer of an end\\nN table.\\nO 110\\nN She turns back with a joint.\\nC Mrs. Samsky\\nD It's something I do. For recreation.\\nN She lights it.\\nC LARRY\\nD That's... Marijuana?\\nC Mrs. Samsky\\nD Mm-hmm.\\nN She hands the joint over.\\nD . You'll find you'll need the iced tea.\\nN LARRY handles the bitty cigarette with trepidation.\\nC LARRY\\nD Is it. . well.. . okay...\\nS THE VERTICAL BLINDS\\nN Some minutes later. They drift and click in the air blown from\\nN the floor vents.\\nN LARRY stares at them.\\nN After a long beat:\\nC LARRY\\nD Maybe Rabbi Scott was right.\\nD Mrs. Samsky\\nD Who's Rabbi Scott?\\nC LARRY\\nD The junior rabbi.\\nD Mrs. Samsky\\nD The junior rabbi.\\nO 111\\nN Another long beat. Neither person feels compelled to speak as\\nN the blinds click.\\nN The joint makes another trip back and forth.\\nN THEN:\\nN . What did he say?\\nC LARRY\\nD He spoke of.. perception. All my problems are just...\\nD just a... a mere..\\nN He trails off, listening.\\nN . Is that a siren?\\nC Mrs. Samsky\\nD No. Some people get a little paranoid when they... Holy\\nD cow... That is a siren.\\nS OUTSIDE\\nN The Samsky's door opens and LARRY stumbles out. He stares.\\nN The police car has stopped in front of his own house next door,\\nN lights still flashing. Two\\nN cops are going up the walk with Uncle Arthur between them in\\nN handcuffs.\\nN LARRY, stunned, walks woodenly toward his house.\\nC LARRY\\nD Hey!\\nD Neither the cops nor Uncle Arthur has heard. They have rung the\\nD doorbell and now\\nN disappear inside.\\nC LARRY projects louder-\\nD . HEY!\\nN -and starts to sprint. Mrs. Samsky has emerged from her house\\nN behind.\\nN LARRY takes the stoop steps two at a time. His door stands open\\nN and the theme from F\\nO 112\\nS Troop issues from within.\\nN Just inside the two policeman stand with their backs to us and\\nN handcuffed Uncle Arthur\\nN in between. The three men face DANNY, who addresses them, projecting\\nN over the music\\nN from the TV.\\nC DANNY\\nD Sort of. He sleeps on the couch.\\nC LARRY\\nD This is crazy!\\nN This brings the cops' look around. Uncle Arthur also turns, shamefaced,\\nN to LARRY.\\nC COP\\nD Does this man live here?\\nC ARTHUR\\nD I didn't know what to tell them! They asked for my\\nD address.. .\\nC LARRY\\nD It's just mathematics! You can't arrest a man for\\nD mathematics!\\nC ARTHUR\\nD I didn't know whether to say I lived here or at the Jolly\\nD Roger.\\nC COP\\nD You know this man?\\nC ARTHUR\\nD I figured this would sound more... I don't know...\\nN Mrs. Samsky appears behind LARRY on the stoop.\\nC DANNY\\nD Dad, why is Uncle Arthur in handcuffs?\\nC LARRY\\nD It's all a mistake. I mean, not a mistake, a, a-\\nO 113\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Hello, Mrs. Samsky.\\nC LARRY\\nD -a miscarriage-\\nC COP\\nD Does this man live here?\\nC DANNY\\nD He sleeps on the couch.\\nC LARRY\\nD Look! What did he do!\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Nothing! I didn't do anything!\\nC DANNY\\nD It folds out. Dad sleeps on a cot.\\nC LARRY\\nD You can't just-\\nC COP\\nD Sir, we picked this man up at the North Dakota.\\nN LARRY is brought up short.\\nC LARRY\\nD The North Dakota!\\nC ARTHUR\\nD But I didn't do anything!\\nC DANNY\\nD Dad, what's the North Dakota?\\nC COP\\nD Solicitation. Sodomy. Very serious.\\nO 114\\nC LARRY\\nD . The North Dakota!\\nN We hold on LARRY's shocked reaction as we hear DANNY, off:\\nC DANNY\\nD What's Sodomy, Dad?\\nC DON MILGRAM\\nN He wears a black armband. He sits thinking, bouncing steepled\\nN fingers against his nose.\\nO FINALLY:\\nC DON\\nD What does Arthur say?\\nC LARRY\\nD He says he didn't do anything.\\nC DON\\nD Uh-huh.\\nC LARRY\\nD He says. . . he just went in for a drink.\\nC DON\\nD Uh-huh.\\nD Long beat.\\nN . Does Arthur drink?\\nC LARRY\\nD No.\\nC DON\\nD Uls-huh.\\nC LARRY\\nD . He says he was confused.\\nO 115\\nC DON\\nD Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well. The North Dakota. Well. You'll\\nD need a criminal attorney.\\nC LARRY\\nD Okay. Who's-\\nC DON\\nD Ron Meshbesher.\\nC LARRY\\nD Is he good?\\nC DON\\nD Ron is very good.\\nN LARRY's gaze wanders. He becomes wistful.\\nC LARRY\\nD I don't understand. He goes to mixers at the Hillel House.\\nC DON\\nD Mm.\\nN A beat.\\nN . I would call Ron Meshbesher.\\nC LARRY\\nD Is he expensive?\\nC DON\\nD Ron is not cheap.\\nN Don focuses on LARRY. Cheerful change of subject:\\nN . DANNY's bar mitzvah is... ?\\nC LARRY\\nD This week.\\nO 116\\nC DON\\nD This shabbas! Great!\\nN He nods.\\nN . It'll be okay. Try to relax, LARRY. Try to relax.\\nN MRS. SAMSKY'S BEDROOM\\nN LARRY is making strenuous love to Mrs. Samsky.\\nN Mrs. Samsky\\nN So good... so good...\\nN She rolls on top of LARRY to straddle him and, still humping,\\nN she lights a mentholated\\nN cigarette. LARRY moans.\\nC LARRY\\nD Oh my God, Mrs. Samsky...\\nN Beyond her head LARRY can see the low cottage-cheese ceiling\\nN of the bedroom. Outside\\nN we can hear Gar Brandt mowing the lawn.\\nN Suddenly we hear muffled laughter and the front door opening.\\nN LARRY panics. He hisses:\\nN . Who is it?\\nN Footsteps are approaching along the hall. Mrs. Samsky doesn't\\nN react; she looks calmly\\nN down at LARRY even as the bedroom door opens behind her and CLIVE\\nN Park walks in\\nN wearing a traffic mask. LARRY is mortified:\\nN CLIVE, please! Wait outside!\\nN Mrs. Samsky blows smoke into LARRY's eyes. The screen goes black.\\nN Close on LARRY as he opens his eyes. A shadow falls across his\\nN face.\\nN His point-of-view: a wooden plank is just being slid into place\\nN over his head. The bang\\nN of hammer on nailhead. In the black:\\nO 117\\nN Sy Ableman's Voice\\nD Nailing it down is so impawtant.\\nN We hear the chanting of Kaddish and the sound of dirt hitting\\nN the top of the coffin. It\\nN drums a steady rhythm. Grace Slick's voice enters: \\\"Somebody\\nN to Love.\\\" In a break in\\nN the vocals right before the chorus:\\nN Mrs. Samsky's Voice\\nD It's something we do. For recreation.\\nN On the chorus downbeat, a crescent moon pops into the black.\\nN Gar Brandt traverses the\\nN sky, pushing his lawn mower. A cow flies the opposite way. Stars\\nN twinkle. Sy Able-\\nN man walks across the sky dressed like a shtetl elder, a bindlestick\\nN over one shoulder.\\nN LARRY bolts upright in bed.\\nN Sudden quiet.\\nN Uncle Arthur is snoring in the tatty motel room's other bed.\\nN A title burns in:\\nC MINDA\\nC LARRY\\nN He stands looking down in low shot. Above him is cheap Johnson-Armstrong\\nD dropped\\nS ceiling.\\nC LARRY\\nD Please. I need help. I've already talked to the other rabbis.\\nD Please.\\nN Reverse shows an elderly eastern European woman seated behind\\nN a desk, looking up at\\nC LARRY.\\nD . I won't take much of his time. I need help. I need\\nD Minda. It's not about DANNY's bar mitzvah. My boy\\nD DANNY. This coming shabbas. Very joyous event. That's\\nD all fine. It's, it's more about myself, I've...

You\\nO 118\\nD know, tried to do right, be a member of the community,\\nN raise the, raise the, DANNY, SARAH, they both go to school,\\nN Hebrew school, a good breakfast. Well, DANNY goes to\\nN Hebrew school, SARAH doesn't have time, she mostly...\\nN washes her hair. Apparently there are several steps\\nN involved. But you don't have to tell Minda that. Just tell\\nN him I need help. Please. I need help.\\nN He lapses into silence, staring at the secretary.\\nN She stares inscrutably back.\\nN After a moment she rises, goes to the door behind her, opens\\nN it, shuffles into the dimness\\nN of an inner office.\\nN LARRY cranes to see past her. Her own body and the dimness interfere\\nN with a good view\\nN of the figure hunched behind the desk. The man is old and bent.\\nN His desktop is empty.\\nN Murmured voices in Hebrew.\\nN A clock ticks in the outer office. LARRY looks around, waiting.\\nN Mysterious Judaica adorns the outer office.\\nN The old woman is shuffling back. She closes the door on the motionless\\nN rabbi and sits\\nN down, heavily, behind her own desk.\\nN SECRETARY\\nN The rabbi is busy.\\nC LARRY\\nD He didn't look busy!\\nN As she starts shuffling papers:\\nC SECRETARY\\nN He's thinking.\\nS NIGHT\\nN Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut.\\nO 119\\nN We are booming down on LARRY, asleep in bed.\\nN We hear weeping, soft, suppressed.\\nN LARRY stirs. He opens his eyes.\\nN After a groggy beat he reacts to the weeping. He looks over.\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur... ? Arthur?\\nN Arthur is a dim mound on the next bed. His weeping continues.\\nN For no reason LARRY continues to keep his voice to a whisper:\\nN . Arthur. What's wrong?\\nN No answer.\\nN . Arthur. It'll be okay. Arthur. We'll get Ron\\nN Meshbesher. It'll be okay-\\nC ARTHUR\\nD AAAHHHH!\\nN Shockingy loud, the scream is hard to interpret.\\nN Arthur flings off his bedclothes. He leaps from the bed and runs\\nN to the door. In boxer\\nN shorts and undershirt he flings the door open and runs out of\\nN the room.\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur!\\nN LARRY leaps from his bed, also in his underwear.\\nN He goes to the door but pauses, peering cautiously outside. Satisfied\\nN that the courtyard is\\nN deserted, he plunges into it.\\nS COURTYARD\\nN The courtyard/parking lot is hardlit by ghastly mercury vapor\\nN lights. The pool,\\nN surrounded by chain-link fence, has been drained. Its white concrete\\nN interior is cracked\\nO 120\\nD and weedy.\\nN Uncle Arthur is hunched weeping in a corner of the pool enclosure.\\nC LARRY\\nE (HISSING)\\nD Arthur!\\nN He opens the creaking gate and scurries over to Arthur.\\nD . You've got to pull yourself together!\\nN Arthur is suddenly angry. His voice bounces off the concrete:\\nC ARTHUR\\nD It's all shit, LARRY! It's all shit!\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur. Don't use that word.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD It's all fucking shit!\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur! Come on!\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Look at everything Hashem has given you! And what do I\\nD get! I get fucking shit!\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur. What do I have. I live at the Jolly Roger.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD You've got a family. You've got a job. Hashem hasn't\\nD given me bupkes.\\nC LARRY\\nD It's not fair to blame Hashem, Arthur. Please. Sometimes\\nD -please calm down-sometimes you have to help your-\\nD self.\\nC ARTHUR\\nC 121\\nD Don't blame me! You fucker!\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur. Please.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Hashem hasn't given me shit. Now I can't even play cards.\\nN He starts weeping again.\\nN LARRY looks around.\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur. This isn't the right forum. Please. Not by the\\nD pool.\\nC Arthur weeps.\\nD Arthur... It's okay... It's okay...\\nS MORNING\\nN LARRY and Arthur are driving. We are looking at the two of them\\nN square through a\\nN windshield in which towering conifers stream by in reflection.\\nN It seems to be a glorious\\nN day.\\nC LARRY\\nD Is this it?\\nN Both men peer out.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD I think so... yeah... there...\\nN He indicates the road ahead.\\nN A SIGNPOST\\nN The old-fashioned kind with wooden fingers pointing the different\\nN directions.\\nN One points toward CANADA.\\nO 122\\nN We tip off the sign as LARRY's car passes and recedes. There\\nN is a canoe strapped to its\\nN roof.\\nN BOUNDARY WATERS\\nD Beautiful, wooded, remote.\\nN The car is parked at water's edge, having backed down a lane\\nN of two tracks worn\\nN through the undergrowth. LARRY and Arthur are lowering the canoe\\nN into water.\\nC LARRY\\nD Okay.. .\\nN He straightens. Arthur straightens. LARRY hugs him.\\nN .Look...\\nN They separate and LARRY pulls a white envelope from his pocket\\nN and gives it to Arthur.\\nN . This'll help you get back on your feet.\\nN Arthur looks into the envelope.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Oh my God. Where did you get this?\\nC LARRY\\nD Doesn't matter. When you-\\nC ARTHUR\\nD This is a lot of money!\\nC LARRY\\nD It should get you started.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD This is a lot of money! Are you sure you don't need it?\\nC LARRY\\nD Arthur, I'm fine. Come on, get in. When you're settled...\\nO 123\\nN Arthur climbs into the canoe.\\nD . let me know how to get in touch.\\nN He helps push the boat off. Arthur is twisted around, looking\\nN back. As he drifts off:\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Are you sure this is okay?\\nC LARRY\\nD It's fine. It's fine...\\nN LARRY waves.\\nN Arthur waves bravely back, then turns to pick up the oars. A\\nN couple of strokes and he\\nN turns back again with a last thought. He calls:\\nC ARTHUR\\nN LARRY. I'm sorry. What I said last night.\\nC LARRY\\nD I know. It's okay.\\nN A lingering look from Arthur, and then he turns back to row.\\nN A gunshot.\\nN Blood spurts from the back of Uncle Arthur's neck.\\nN He slumps forward, dead.\\nC VOICE\\nS Good shot!\\nN LARRY looks wildly around. He sees:\\nN Gar Brandt and Mitch in their camo fatigues, hard to pick out\\nN in the foliage. They are\\nN looking off toward the canoe, Mitch just lowering his rifle.\\nN Gar Brandt's look swings around, into the lens. He points at\\nN us:\\nN There's another Jew, son.\\nO 124\\nN Mitch swings his rifle toward us.\\nN He fires.\\nC LARRY\\nD Gasping awake in the motel room.\\nN He looks around.\\nN It is dawn.\\nN Arthur sits on the edge of his bed in his underwear, staring\\nN off into space, slackjawed,\\nN vacant-eyed, drained.\\nN LARRY gazes around the room, waiting for things to fall into\\nN place.\\nN Finally, blearily:\\nC LARRY\\nD Were we... out at the pool last night?\\nN Arthur, still staring off, responds in a flat, empty voice:\\nC ARTHUR\\nD Yes. I'm sorry.\\nN LARRY blinks sleep away.\\nN After a beat:\\nC LARRY\\nD It's shabbas.\\nD Another beat.\\nN Arthur heaves a deep sigh.\\nC ARTHUR\\nD I'll go drain my cyst.\\nO 125\\nS RESTROOM\\nS Day. A two-urinal, two-stall men's room of old tile and yellowed\\nN fixtures.\\nN We are low. One of the stall doors is closed. Under it we see\\nN the dress shoes and dress\\nN pants of two young men standing inside.\\nN We hear a long sucking inhale.\\nN Ronnie Nudell's Voice\\nD Gimme that fucker.\\nN A loudly projected echoing male voice:\\nN VOICE\\nD Ya'amod hab'rayshit.\\nS SANCTUARY\\nN DANNY, seated in the second pew next to his parents and sister\\nN and Uncle Arthur, rises\\nN and shuffles along the row to the aisle. His eyes are wide and\\nN red-rimmed.\\nN The prelapped voice was his call to the torah. All eyes in the\\nN congregation, which fills\\nN the large sanctuary, are on him.\\nN In great echoing silence he walks to the steps on the right side\\nN of the bema and climbs.\\nN The right-side lectern is surrounded by a gaggle of old Jewish\\nN men. They busy\\nN themselves with the preparation of the pair of scrolls on the\\nN lectern, rolling them,\\nN pausing, rolling some more, muttering prayers, kissing the scrolls\\nN by means of their\\nN tsitsim. They pay DANNY no attention.\\nN DANNY takes his place centered behind the lectern. His chin comes\\nN up to the bottom of\\nS the reading platform.\\nN Men continue to mutter prayers around him. A pair of hands appear\\nN on his shoulders\\nN from behind. DANNY looks down at the strange hands. They pull\\nN him back.\\nN A foot drags a small riser out from under the lectern.\\nN Hands push DANNY up onto the riser.\\nO 126\\nN Booming up on the torah scrolls, still being busily rolled.\\nN Beyond it, a sea of faces.\\nN The yad-a molded tin pointer-is thrust into DANNY's hand. The\\nN non-pointing end has\\nN a red silken tassel.\\nN DANNY looks at the bouncing tassel. He looks at the little pointing\\nN finger which is the\\nN business end of the yad.\\nN Men mutter around him, each a different prayer. They dip and\\nN doven.\\nN DANNY watches himself point the yad down at the scroll.\\nN The scroll is a dense swarm of Hebrew letters. DANNY squints.\\nN One voice separates from the murmurs around him. It chants, insistently,\\nN in a sotto-voce\\nN FALSETTO:\\nD VOICE\\nN Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot...\\nN DANNY is still staring at the end of the yad against the parchment\\nN scroll.\\nN Someone's hand enters and moves the yad to a different place\\nN in the text.\\nN The voice repeats:\\nN . Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot...\\nN DANNY looks up from the scrolls.\\nN In the congregation Ronnie Nudell sits hunched-shouldered and\\nN squished between his\\nN parents. He returns DANNY's red-rimmed slack-jawed stare.\\nN The insistent voice:\\nN . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot...\\nN DANNY looks over.\\nN From the surrounding scrum the prompter nods at him. He looks\\nN somewhat like Cantor\\nC Youssele Rosenblatt.\\nO 127\\nN . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot.. .\\nN DANNY looks back down at the scroll. A hand enters to tap a pointing\\nN finger where the\\nD yad points.\\nS . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effa-\\nN DANNY suddenly erupts:\\nC DANNY\\nD Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot. .\\nC PROMPTER\\nD Mm-hm.\\nN DANNY continues to boom out the torah portion. He moves the yad\\nN along the line of\\nS letters.\\nN In the congregation, LARRY and Judith watch. We hear DANNY chanting\\nN fluently and\\nN LARRY squeezes the hand Judith has laced through his arm.\\nN Juith whispers:\\nC JUDITH\\nD I'm sorry that... things have been so hard for us...\\nC LARRY\\nD It's okay.\\nC JUDITH\\nN Sy had so much respect for you, LARRY.\\nN He pats her hand.\\nN A beat.\\nN . He wrote letters to the tenure committee.\\nO LATER\\nN The congregation is loudly singing V'Zos Hatorah.

VAN - DAY\\nN MARCIE is wide-eyed, looking at the lush surroundings.\\nC MARCIE\\nN It's beautiful...\\nC NED\\nD Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't\\nD seen a coat of paint in six years.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 30    EXT. CAMP DRIVE - DAY\\nN The CAMERA SEES what NED saw.  The buildings are run down at\\nN the heels.  It is the same camp we saw in the early scenes, but\\nN time has torn the place badly.\\nN The van passes the CAMERA and we see the three new ARRIVALS\\nN looking out the window.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 31    EXT. MAIN CAMP AREA - DAY\\nN This is the main building.  It is the building where Barry and\\nN Claudette met.  Outside is a flagpole, a small parking area, a\\nN large overhanging tree.\\nN In the BG we can see part of the lake.\\nN In the FG there is a Jeep.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 32    EXT. CAMP MAIN AREA - DAY\\nN An axe flashes through the FRAME and hacks apart the halves of\\nN a huge tree stump.\\nN The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a middle-aged man in cut-offs,\\nN a bare chest, hiking boots and beat-up cowboy hat.  This is\\nN STEVE CHRISTY.  He is strong, charming, and engaging.  He is\\nN animated, always in motion, impatient with how long it takes to\\nN do things.\\nN In the BG the van comes to a stop.  No sooner has JACK hopped\\nN down, than STEVE is beckoning him over.\\nC STEVE\\nD Wanta give me a hand here?\\nN JACK smiles and comes quickly.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD Alice?\\nN NED steps down from the van and now we can see that he has had\\nN polio when he was a kid.  His upper body is strong, but his\\nN legs are slightly deformed.  He and MARCIE hustle over to the\\nN big stump.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD Wanta roll this sucker out of the way.\\nD Alice?\\nN ALICE comes into the MS.  She is carrying a shovel and a bucket\\nN and has obviously been working for a couple of hours.\\nC ALICE\\nN Cabin B is ready.\\nC STEVE\\nN Push on this side.  Alice, this is Jack,\\nN Marcie and Ned.  Push.\\nN They exchange \\\"hellos\\\" as they bend to the work.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD That's got her.  Thanks.  I'm Steve\\nD Christy.  Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.\\nD You got some grubby clothes?  Climb into\\nN 'em.  Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out\\nN the boathouse.  I want him to start with\\nN the canoes.  What happened to Brenda?\\nC ALICE\\nD You told her to sweep the courts.\\nN STEVE sets off.\\nC STEVE\\nD I'd rather she painted.  Let's go, folks.\\nN As soon as he's gone, NED turns to ALICE.\\nC NED\\nD I thought we had two weeks...\\nN ALICE shrugs.\\nC ALICE\\nD You can changed in three.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 33    EXT. EDGE OF LAKE - DAY\\nN The CAMERA looks down a long line of canoes, each with its hull\\nN up.  A brush slaps into view.  BILL is sweating while finishing\\nN a coat of paint on the last canoe.\\nN BILL is a thin, ascetic-looking college sophomore.  He rubs his\\nN long thin rose with the back of his wrist as he hears someone\\nN call his name OS.  He turns to see ALICE at the bottom of the\\nN trail.\\nC ALICE\\nD Steve said for you to start on the boats.\\nC BILL\\nD I finished the boats.\\nN ALICE nods slowly.\\nC ALICE\\nD I'll tell him.\\nN She turns away.\\nC BILL\\nD Alice?  The others show up?\\nC ALICE\\nD Everybody except the girl who's supposed\\nN to handle the kitchen.

GIRL'S CABIN - DAY\\nN STEVE and NED are rehanging a door.  Next to them is BRENDA, a\\nN dark Eurasian girl who is trying to do a good job of painting\\nN the wall.  On the other side MARCIE is scraping some flaking\\nN paint.\\nC STEVE\\nD Shim it up just a scooch.\\nN NED levers the door higher at the top.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD Perfection.  Hold it.\\nN STEVE uses a long ratchet screwdriver.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD To answer your question, my parents once\\nD owned this camp.  There were some tragic\\nD accidents and they went bankrupt.  I\\nD promised them I'd reopen if I could.\\nD See if it closes right now.\\nN NED swings the door on its hinges.\\nC NED\\nD Looks good.\\nC STEVE\\nD Perfection. Did you meet Brenda?\\nN BRENDA turns and nods.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD She's archery.  He's rifle ranged.  And\\nD I'm behind schedule.  Let's go, Ned.\\nN They exit with the tool box.  MARCIE stops and turns to BRENDA,\\nN who looks upward and blows the hair from her forehead.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 35    EXT. EDGE OF THE LAKE - DAY\\nN STEVE, ALICE, BRENDA, MARCIE, NED, JACK and BILL are lugging a\\nN swimming float down to the water's edge.  STEVE supervises as\\nN he carries the thing, which is quite heavy.  They ad-lid as\\nN appropriate.  (\\\"There goes my hernia.\\\" \\\"Are you sure you're\\nN lifting?\\\" \\\"Not so fast.\\\" \\\"I'm walking backward.\\\")\\nN They drop the things carefully.\\nC STEVE\\nD Come on back here and let's above the\\nD float in.\\nN They get behind it and shove it into the water.  NED hops\\nN aboard for the ride, flipping into a handstand.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 36    INT. EQUIPMENT SHED - DAY\\nN The screen has gone completely black.  The door to the shed is\\nN whipped open quickly, letting in the full brightness of the\\nN sun.  There is a shape.\\nN The CAMERA IRISES DOWN so that we can see that JACK has come in\\nN on an errand.\\nN As JACK looks around, we can take the time to see that there\\nN are a half-dozen lantern, a few cans of lantern fuel, a couple\\nN of hibachis, some entrenching tools packs, portable ice chests,\\nN etc.  Up on the long side wall are a half-dozen hunting knives\\nN in sheathes, also hanging neatly.\\nN Suddenly a hand comes into FRAME and touches JACK on the\\nN shoulder as he is preoccupied with his task.  JACK turns with\\nN a start.  He looks into the CAMERA.\\nN REVERSE POV to see MARCIE standing in the doorway.\\nC MARCIE\\nD What are those for?  An Indian raid?\\nN She points to the row of hatchets and knives.\\nC JACK\\nD Steve's got a woodlore program.  You see\\nD any life rings?\\nN MARCIE looks behind some piled up equipment.  She pulls out two\\nN rings.\\nC MARCIE\\nD Here.

ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - DAY\\nN STEVE CHRISTY comes upon ALICE, who is renailing floorboards on\\nN the porch of the Arts & Crafts cabin.  On the railing is a\\nN sketch pad which Steve thumbs through.\\nN INSERT:  ALICE'S SKETCH.  It is a moody pierce, a sense of\\nN foreboding dominates it.  Otherwise, it is the camp's central\\nN compound, featuring the tree that forms the central focus.\\nC STEVE\\nD You draw very well.\\nC ALICE\\nD Oh, thanks.  I wish I could spend more\\nD time at it.\\nN ALICE misses a nail and hits her thumb.  She reacts good-\\nN naturedly and keeps on working.\\nN STEVE bends down next to ALICE.\\nC STEVE\\nD This isn't your cup of tea, hunh?\\nN She shakes her head.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD Any particular reason?\\nC ALICE\\nD Just a feeling.\\nE (pause)\\nD Nothing personal.\\nC STEVE\\nE (nodding)\\nD You want to leave?\\nC ALICE\\nD I don't know.  Probably be best for\\nD everybody.\\nC STEVE\\nD You may not care a lot about this place,\\nD Alice, but I mean to make it my whole\\nD life.  It's been my whole life.  Gimme\\nD a chance.  Stay a week.  Help get it\\nD ready.  Next Friday, if you're not\\nD happy, I'll put you on the bus myself.\\nD I'll be grateful.\\nN He puts out a hand and runs the back of it across her cheek.\\nN She looks up.  She nods.\\nC ALICE\\nN Next Friday.\\nC STEVE\\nD Thanks, Alice.\\nN He stands up.\\nC STEVE\\nE (continuing)\\nD I've got to go to town and pick up the\\nD trailer and all that other stuff, but\\nD I'll be back around ten.  If you're\\nD still up, we can talk, okay?\\nC ALICE\\nO Sure.\\nN She watches him cross out of FRAME.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 38    EXT. MAIN CABIN AREA - DAY (LATER)\\nN STEVE is at the wheel of his Jeep.  The COUNSELLORS are\\nN standing within earshot, huddled around the Jeep.\\nC JACK\\nD You want it listed separately?\\nC STEVE\\nD Yeah.  Brenda, after lunch hit the\\nD archery range.  If Annie gets here, have\\nD her start in on the kitchen.  Do your\\nD best.  Tomorrow we have a preliminary\\nS inspection by the state safety people.\\nD I'd like to look good.\\nN He wheels the car around and out the driveway.  The others\\nN stand looking before NED breaks the silence.\\nC NED\\nD He neglected to mention this place is\\nD called \\\"Camp Blood\\\" downtown.\\nN They are all getting back to work.\\nC ALICE\\nD How come?\\nC NED\\nD Some campers drowned.  Then some\\nD counsellors got killed.\\nC BILL\\nD No shit.  When?\\nC NED\\nD Late fifties sometime.  They never\\nD caught the guy who did it either.\\nC MARCIE\\nD Neddy collects weird facts.  Next he is\\nD going to tell us that there are poisonous\\nD snakes in the outhouse and green lizards\\nD in the lake.\\nN As they laugh, the CAMERA HOLDS on ALICE.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 39    EXT. ARCHERY RANGE - DAY\\nN BRENDA has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job.  She\\nN enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of\\nN this area.  She likes to think of herself as more sophisticated\\nN than she is--or have others think her more sophisticated.\\nN BRENDA rolls a straw target out from under the lean-to shelter\\nN and heads for a tripod in the middle distance.  There are\\nN already two such targets out, a product of her efforts so far.\\nN The targets are heavy.  This isn't an easy one-person job.\\nN The CAMERA CLOSES IN tighter and tighter on her as she gets\\nN closer to setting up the target.\\nN In MCU, she lifts a target up.  Her head is very close to the\\nN face of the target.  She gets it up, lets the tripod take the\\nN weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow\\nN streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by\\nN eighteen inches.\\nN BRENDA whips around.\\nN WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  a very cocky NED, standing by the lean-\\nN to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked\\nN simultaneously.  He has a feather stuck in his hair.\\nN She grabs the arrow and storms at him.\\nC BRENDA\\nD You're crazy!\\nN She snaps the arrow in half.\\nC NED\\nD Did anyone ever tell you you're\\nD beautiful when you're angry?\\nC BRENDA\\nE (plussed)\\nD I don't believe you...\\nC NED\\nD Want to see my trick shot?  It's even\\nD better.\\nN BRENDA still thinks he's a jerk, but he's so outrageous there's\\nN little she can do.  She laughs.\\nC BRENDA\\nE (still laughing)\\nD You ever fire one of those bows again,\\nD and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.\\nC NED\\nD God, but I love that sexy talk.\\nN BRENDA snatches the bow from him, shakes her head and puts the\\nN bow down next to a collection of wicked-looking arrows.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 40    INT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - DAY\\nN This is a fairly large single room.  The walls are bare and\\nN uninsulated.  There are a few easels, but for the most part,\\nN the room is dominated by long tables and rough-hewn benches.\\nN The light seeps through the streaked windows, making the grey\\nN wood interior appear silver-colored.  ALICE, her hair in a\\nN bandana, has just finished sweeping up.\\nN The CAMERA picks up on ALICE's sketch of the central camp area\\nN on one easel.  On a second easel she has done the preliminary\\nN sketch of the lake itself.  It is also a moody picture.\\nN ALICE cocks her head to look at the sketches, shivers just a\\nN little, then goes on to her next task.  There is a row of newly-\\nN arrived cardboard boxes.  She opens the first in CU with a\\nN matte knife.  She take out the invoice and checks it against\\nN the first items:  gimp, the plastic string from which all the\\nN campers will make lanyards.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 41    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - DAY\\nN We watch through one of the dusty panes, seeing the charcoal\\nN sketch in the FG, ALICE in the BG checking her materials\\nN against her invoice.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 42    INT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - DAY (INTERCUT)\\nN ALICE snaps around, sensing that she is being watched.  In CU\\nN her frightened face looks at the sun-drenched dusty pane.  Her\\nN face relaxes until BANG!  The sound of a door slamming echoes\\nN through the room.\\nN The CAMERA ZOOMS BACK from her face to see someone standing in\\nN the doorway.\\nN It is BILL.\\nC BILL\\nD Sorry.  How you doing?\\nN ALICE smiles, then turns back to her job of taking inventory.\\nN BILL watches her.\\nC ALICE\\nD Did you want something?\\nN She starts to take a box down from a high shelf.  She doesn't\\nN realize that there is something on top of the box.\\nC BILL\\nD Steve said you were thinking of leaving.\\nD True?\\nC ALICE\\nD Un-hunh.\\nN ALICE lugs down the box and suddenly a bunch of leather-working\\nN tools clatters down, shattering the silence.  ALICE fends off\\nN the flying implements and BILL rushes to her side.\\nC ALICE\\nE (continuing)\\nD Oh, my God...\\nC BILL\\nD You okay?\\nN She nods.\\nC BILL\\nE (continuing)\\nD You're lucky.\\nN They stoop down to pick up the fallen tools from the floor.\\nN BILL looks at her while they work.\\nC BILL\\nE (continuing)\\nD How come you're leaving?\\nC ALICE\\nD It's long and personal.  It has nothing\\nD to do with you or the other kids.\\nC BILL\\nD Maybe I can help?\\nN ALICE looks at BILL and smiles.  This really is a very nice, if\\nN naive, young man.\\nC ALICE\\nD And it's this place.  It makes no sense,\\nN but it spooks me.\\nC BILL\\nE (smiling)\\nD You're right.  It makes no sense.\\nN As ALICE nods, she is interrupted by a shrill scream outside.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 43    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - DAY\\nN MARCIE is the source of the scream.  She runs towards the\\nN CAMERA, dressed in cut-offs and a floral halter.  Her feet are\\nN bare.  When she get closer, we see that she is being chased by\\nN JACK and NED who have found two giant green bullfrogs.  The\\nN screams were not serious and MARCIE is doing some of it for\\nN effect.  BRENDA brings up the rear.  They are all dressed more\\nN or less for a frolic in the lake.\\nN BILL and ALICE stand in front of the Arts & Crafts cabin.  BILL\\nN is smiling, ALICE is a little bit amused.\\nC MARCIE\\nD Help me!  Save me!  The frog people are\\nD after me!  It's swim time at Camp Crystal\\nN Lake.  Come on, Alice, I need protection!\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 44    EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - DAY\\nN A LONG WIDE SHOT reveals the cool, clear lake during the lull\\nN of a hot afternoon.\\nN At the edge of the lake, in the shallows, are the members of\\nN the group:  MARCIE, JACK, NED, BRENDA, BILL and ALICE.  They\\nN are sitting or paddling or diving off the float.  There is no\\nN real attempt to exert too much energy.\\nN Gradually we become aware that this LONG WIDE SHOT is someone's\\nN POV.  The CAMERA moves from its stable position, now hand-held,\\nN on a trajectory around the side of the lake, out of sight.\\nN Branches, brush, and twigs are butted through.  Occasionally,\\nN we can see part of the PROWLER's arm fending off the underbrush.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 45    EXT. WATER - DAY\\nN The group sits or lies in the cool water, more or less focused\\nN on NED, who is acting as moderator.\\nC NED\\nD What do you want to be when you grow up?\\nC BRENDA\\nD Dancer.\\nC MARCIE\\nD Cowboy.\\nC NED\\nD Girls can't be cowboys.\\nC MARCIE\\nD Okay, Fireman.\\nN NED goes to JACK.\\nC NED\\nD Jack?\\nC JACK\\nD Coach, athletic director somewhere.\\nC BILL\\nD Filmmaker.\\nC ALICE\\nD Artist.\\nC NED\\nD Doctor.

LAKE - DAY\\nN ALICE is treading water, talking with BRENDA, as NED comes up\\nN out of nowhere.\\nC BRENDA\\nD Vitamin C's supposed to neutralize the\\nD nitrites or something.\\nN NED surfaces between them.  He looks with googly eyes at ALICE.\\nC NED\\nD There are sand sharks in this lake and\\nD they can eat the bathing suit right off\\nD you.\\nN ALICE laughs.\\nC NED\\nE (continuing)\\nD See?  I'm getting to you.  Very slowly.\\nN NED does a porpoise drive and disappears.\\nN BRENDA is not laughing.  She is looking off towards the cabin\\nN area.\\nN ALICE sees her and look where she looks.\\nC ALICE\\nN What'd you see?\\nC BRENDA\\nD I don't know.  Marcie's got me paranoid.\\nN She smiles.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 48    EXT. BEHIND ALICE'S CABIN - DAY\\nN The CAMERA, shooting from the PROWLER's POV, moves to a place\\nN alongside Alice's cabin.  There is underbrush about two feet\\nN tall and all around that area.  The PROWLER stops, leans down\\nN and reaches into FRAME with a gloved hand.\\nN The gloved hand reaches into the underbrush for the tip of a\\nN burlap bag which has been secreted there.  The hand lifts the\\nN bag, which has something in it that moves.\\nN The CAMERA MOVES around to the side of the cabin right below\\nN the window.  The window is open, making entry quite simple.\\nN The PROWLER's gloved hands untie the neck of the bag, reach in\\nN and haul out quickly a medium-sized snake.  One hand has the\\nN animal firmly behind the jaws.  The hand takes the snake and\\nN puts it through the open window, leaving it on the clean white\\nN coverlet.  It slithers across the bed.\\nN The PROWLER's hand closes the window.\\nN The CAMERA MOVES towards one of the sheds.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 49    EXT. EDGE OF LAKE - DAY\\nN BILL and ALICE are lying on the shore on their towels, watching\\nN the OTHERS in the water and grabbing some afternoon sun.  ALICE\\nN is on her stomach, tracing angular designs in the sand.

He wipes the perspiration\\nN from his eyes and continues along.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 51    EXT. BEHIND THE MAIN CABIN - DAY\\nN Set up behind the cabin is a make-shift exercise area.  There\\nN are chinning bars--pipeslashed between two trees--and there's\\nN an aging set of parallel bars.  There is even a set of weights\\nN made from tin cans, pipes and assorted amount of cement.\\nN ECU of NEDS's face in a distorted, twisted expression.  He\\nN explodes his breath.\\nN We PULL BACK to see BRENDA watching NED work out on the uneven\\nN parallel bars.  He is really very good and there is no doubt\\nN about his strength.\\nC BRENDA\\nD Not bad.\\nN As NED moves off the apparatus, BRENDA comes in and does a neat\\nN little turn which is dazzling.  NED does a take.\\nC NED\\nD Holy shit...\\nC BRENDA\\nD We wouldn't want you thinking you're the\\nD only show-off in camp, would we?\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 52    EXT. LAKE - DAY\\nN The sun has dropped lower on the horizon.\\nN The CAMERA looks down on ALICE as she sleeps peacefully in the\\nN late sun.

Steve is going to have a\\nN small cow.\\nN They walk away from the shore.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 53    EXT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY\\nN ALICE is walking quicker than BILL.  We realize we have seen\\nN this cabin before--when the snake was placed in it.\\nC BILL\\nD You can only do what you can do.\\nC ALICE\\nD And then Steve looks at you with those\\nD hurt eyes--like you don't care about\\nD children...\\nN BILL laughs at her imitation.\\nC ALICE\\nE (continuing)\\nD I'll see you later.\\nN She turns to go up the steps to her front door.\\nC BILL\\nD Alice?\\nN She stops and look down at him.  He is serious and he cares.\\nN ALICE appreciates what's she's just heard.  She knows that it\\nN wasn't easy for BILL to say.\\nC ALICE\\nD You're very nice.\\nN They share a short silent moment.\\nC BILL\\nD Hope you will.\\nN BILL smiles and turns and jogs off, still carrying his long\\nN blade.\\nN ALICE watches him go.  She shrugs.  This might be a good place\\nN to stay.  She turns and goes into her cabin.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 54    INT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY\\nN In the FG is the camp bed with its white coverlet.  The snake\\nN is nowhere in sight--which means it could be anywhere.\\nN ALICE is humming to herself and is happier now than she has\\nN been since we met her.\\nN The room is small.  There is the metal-frame cot, an old wooden\\nN dresser with a cloudy mirror on top.  The walls are a light\\nN blue, freshly painted.  The wall on the inside does not go all\\nN the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on\\nN in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side.\\nN ALICE looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what\\nN she sees.  She pushes her hair so that she looks a little\\nN sexier.  She smiles at herself.\\nN She reaches out in CU.  Open a drawer.  Takes out a towel.\\nN ALICE turns and goes to her footlocker.  Bends down and opens\\nN it up.  Takes out a terrycloth robe.\\nN She closes the footlocker, stands up and heads out the door.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 55    EXT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY\\nN ALICE heads from her cabin to the showers.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 56    INT. SHOWER ROOM - DAY\\nN ALICE walks into her room wearing her bathrobe, her hair in a\\nN towel-turban.  She flicks off her shower clogs, and looks for\\nN her hairbrush.  She takes her towel off and lets her tangled\\nN hair fall down.\\nN She hums.  Opens her top drawer.  Nothing there.\\nN Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there.\\nN Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there.\\nN ALICE opens the fourth drawer and the snake strikes!  It flails\\nN at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier\\nN as having a Navajo bracelet on it.  The snake strikes the\\nN bracelet, hangs on as ALICE tries to shake it free.  The snake\\nN falls to the floor and recoils for another attack.\\nN There is no way that ALICE can get past the snake to run away.\\nN Her scream is loud.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 57    EXT. MAIN CABIN - DAY\\nN BILL, returning from his last half hour of trail-blazing, hears\\nN ALICE.\\nS ALICE (O.S.)\\nD Help!\\nN BILL doesn't hesitate.  Carrying his machete, he runs to\\nN ALICE's cabin.\\nN MARCIE and JACK follow in the BG.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 58    INT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY\\nN ALICE is backed against the wall.  The snake could strike and\\nN get her.\\nN BILL runs into the room, still carrying his machete.  He looks\\nN at ALICE.\\nC ALICE\\nE (a tight whisper)\\nD There's a fucking snake in here.\\nN BILL sees it.  He freezes, then takes a step forward.\\nN Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the\\nN machete, cutting the snake into two pieces.  Blood spurts onto\\nS the floor.\\nN MARCIE and JACK enter.  JACK carries a shovel as a weapon.\\nN MARCIE stops when she sees the embrace, but then looks further\\nN to see the blood and guts.\\nC MARCIE\\nD Steve never mentioned serpents.  Jack,\\nD would you get some paper towels?\\nN JACK nods and exits.\\nC ALICE\\nN How the... did he get in there?\\nC BILL\\nD Slipped in.  Probably liked the scent of\\nD your perfume.\\nN JACK return and tosses a roll to MARCIE.\\nC MARCIE\\nO Thanks.\\nC BILL\\nD You okay now?\\nN ALICE nods.\\nN BILL gives her an extra hug.  Then steps back awkwardly,\\nN stepping on MARCIE's big toe.\\nC MARCIE\\nD Go ahead.  I walk on 'em all the time.\\nE (to JACK)\\nD Would you shovel Mr. Snake outta here?\\nN JACK nods.  He picks up his shovel and we see in CU as he gets\\nN underneath the wide-fanged snake.\\nN MARCIE begins to clean the blood off the floor with the paper\\nN toweling.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 59    EXT. CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON\\nN Looking across the lake, we can see the camp, nestled in among\\nN the late afternoon rays of the sun.

He looks\\nN in--there is enough gas.  He puts the cap back on.\\nN Then his eye catches something.  He looks at the broken plug.\\nN He shakes his head and looks around for a wrench to fix it.  He\\nN puts the rifle down on the floor of the shed.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 115    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT\\nN ALICE sits up into the CAMERA, startled and afraid.\\nN ALICE\\nN Bill?!\\nN She gets her bearings and looks around.  Stands up.  She looks\\nN at the bulb overhead.

The door\\nN doesn't budge.\\nN REACTION SHOT:  ALICE decides to pull harder.\\nN She puts down her lamp and uses both hands and tugs.  She pulls\\nN until she finally wrenches the door open.  The lamp casts long\\nN shadows upwards.\\nN The generator sits silent.\\nN ALICE leans into the shed to look.\\nN The CAMERA TRACKS very slowly around behind her so that we can\\nN see behind the right-hand corner of the building.  As we clear\\nN the edge, we see something hanging from a rope which runs down\\nN from a branch above.\\nN The something turns slowly in the wind.  It is BILL--dead--in\\nN a travesty of the martyrdom of St. Sebastian, shot with arrows.\\nN ALICE comes out of the shed, distraught.\\nN ALICE\\nN Bill?\\nN She closes the door, and turns in the direction of the body.\\nN REACTION SHOT:  ALICE.  She is riveted with horror, unable to\\nN move or turn or run.

VOORHEES is coming down the aisle between the two tables.\\nN Her machete is coming up in an attack.\\nN ALICE reaches into the box in CU and pulls out a handful of\\nN leather-working tools.  She hurls them at MRS. VOORHEES as hard\\nN as she can.\\nN MRS. VOORHEES has to put her arms up to ward off the spinning\\nN knives.  One cuts her under the eye and she lets out a low\\nN animal bellow.\\nN ALICE leaps up, climbs over the table and runs for the door.\\nN MRS.

A shadow covers ALICE's back.  She\\nN turns.\\nN ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES is standing in the doorway,\\nN blocking the light.  Still carrying the machete, MRS. VOORHEES\\nN steps slowly toward ALICE.\\nN ALICE, with an almost useless .22 in her hands, does the only\\nN thing she can.  She takes the weapon by the barrel and,\\nN swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks MRS. VOORHEES on the\\nN arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall.\\nN MRS. VOORHEES slams through a flimsy table, crushing it, and\\nN drops to the floor.\\nN ALICE runs out the door.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 132    EXT. MAIN CABIN FRONT - NIGHT\\nN ALICE huffs past the dead camper van, through the mud to the\\nN front door of the main cabin.  She runs in quickly.  There is\\nN no sign of MRS. VOORHEES.

LARDER - NIGHT\\nN There is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices.\\nN ALICE's hands fasten onto the inside lock--the dead bolt type\\nN which requires a key to unlock it from the other side.\\nN ALICE relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside.\\nN As soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam.\\nN Then we hear some shuffling around outside.  The lights are\\nN turned on.\\nC JASON (V.O.)\\nD Please kill her, mommy... Help me,\\nD please.  Kill her, mommy.\\nN There is the sound of pots being rustled through.  Then the\\nN sound of another door being slammed.\\nN ALICE relaxes again.\\nN Then there is a silence.  ALICE thinks about unlocking the door\\nN now.  She reaches out for the lock.  Then thinks better of the\\nN idea.\\nN She cases down the door frame to the floor.  On all sides are\\nN the cans of food and cooking implements.  There is a large\\nN skillet, some bags of flour, etc.\\nN ALICE covers her head with her arms.\\nN The doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very\\nN slowly.  We see it, but she does not.  MRS. VOORHEES' hand\\nN finishes turning and now starts to push gently.  There is\\nN almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested.\\nN The voice on the other side is very young, very sing-song.\\nC JASON (O.S.)\\nN Come out, come out, wherever you are...\\nN ALICE jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small\\nN room.\\nN Fists bang in a rage on the floor.\\nN ALICE\\nO Please...\\nN ALICE folds her hands at the side of her face.\\nN The fist-banging gives way to a short silence.\\nN The silence is interrupted by a new sound:  MRS. VOORHEES has\\nN begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the\\nS door to the larder.\\nN REACTION SHOT:  ALICE... oh, my God...\\nN At first we see nothing on our side.  Then, gradually, we see\\nN little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops.  ALICE's\\nN eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense,\\nN anything...\\nN Larger holes are now made.  MRS. VOORHEES stops just long enough\\nN to take a peck inside.  We can see her eye at the largest hole.\\nN She goes back to whacking away at the door.  The hole is near\\nN the lock.  It is soon big enough for MRS. VOORHEES to reach\\nN inside with her hand and turn the rachet.\\nN ALICE realizes she must defend herself.  She reaches down and\\nN picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, ALICE raises\\nN her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to\\nN come through the entrance.\\nN MRS. VOORHEES chops down with the machete.  ALICE fends off the\\nN blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her\\nN head.  As the machete blade bounces off the skillet, ALICE is\\nN able to swing the skillet downward and hit MRS. VOORHEES with\\nN a solid blow on top of her head.  MRS. VOORHEES sprawls\\nN sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the\\nN floor.\\nN ALICE raises the skillet again to strike.  She crosses\\nN carefully to MRS. VOORHEES and pushes her gently with her foot,\\nN the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway.\\nN ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert.  There is a\\nN small puddle of blood under her head.\\nN ANGLE ON ALICE:  She relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses\\nN slowly out of the room.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 135    EXT.

The birds are\\nN up, foraging for food.\\nN As the CAMERA scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky\\nN reflected in the calm waters of Crystal Lake.  The canoe\\nN holding ALICE is drifting in big slow circles across the\\nN surface of the lake.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 138    EXT. LAKE - DAWN\\nN ALICE lies, in MCU, in the canoe, sleeping.  She has not\\nN changed her position since collapsing a few hours before.  The\\nN water laps gently against the side of the canoe.  Very slowly,\\nN she wakes.  She opens her eyes.\\nN The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree\\nN boughs that overhang the edge of the lake.\\nN They shade ALICE from the bright rays of the sun.  The canoe\\nN rocks gently.  ALICE is still, listening to the sound of the\\nN lapping water.\\nN Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a MUSICAL STINGER,\\nN and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of MRS.\\nN VOORHEES, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe,\\nN barely missing ALICE's slumped form!\\nN The canoe immediately overturns and both MRS. VOORHEES and ALICE\\nN try to find their footing in the shallow water.  MRS. VOORHEES\\nN is covered in mud and blood.  She sees ALICE struggling to get\\nN up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete.\\nN ALICE turns, sees MRS. VOORHEES coming.  ALICE grabs a paddle\\nN floating near her.\\nN MRS. VOORHEES pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the\\nN waist-high water as fast as she can.  She screams with rage.\\nN Her face goes through a horrifying transformation.  From her\\nN mouth comes the VOICE OF JASON.\\nS JASON (Lipsync)\\nD Mommy!  Mommy!  Mommy!\\nN ALICE can't move fast enough to get away from MRS. VOORHEES,\\nN who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit ALICE.\\nN ALICE slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has\\nN to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle,\\nN using it like a staff to ward off the blow.  The machete cuts\\nN the paddle nearly in half.  MRS. VOORHEES raises the knife for\\nN another blow and ALICE lunges for her knees and succeeds in\\nN throwing MRS. VOORHEES into the water.  The machete flies out\\nN of her hand and lands in the water.  The two women roll in the\\nN water.  MRS. VOORHEES is trying to strangle ALICE, her hands\\nN stretching to reach around her throat.  They roll over and\\nN under the water.  We cannot see who is winning.\\nN Suddenly MRS. VOORHEES finds her footing and stands up, looking\\nN for ALICE.  She is screeching madly.\\nC JASON (Lipsync)\\nE (continuing)\\nD Kill her, mommy!  Kill her, mommy!\\nN ALICE shoots up out of the water holding the machete, and in\\nN one, wild swing, decapitates MRS. VOORHEES, whose head flies\\nN off into the water.\\nN The body stands for a minute, then falls heavily into the lake.\\nN ALICE drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to\\nN shore.\\nT CUT TO:\\nS 139    EXT.

Is\\nD that all he wrote about you?\\nC DAVID\\nD I don't think he ever got over the\\nD fact that I was terrified of\\nD heights. And when he and my\\nD mother were run over by a drunken\\nD teenager on New Year's Eve, ten\\nD years ago...\\nN David Aames moves closer to the light. We see a strange\\nN bland expression of his mask, at first other--worldly... and\\nN then more clearly.\\nC DAVID\\nD he left the keys to the\\nD Kingdom to me...    51% control,   49%\\nD going to a group of seven board\\nD members who all thought they were\\nD first in line.\\nC MCCABE\\nD And you believe the Board, the\\nD Seven Dwarves, put you here to\\nD take control of your company.\\nC DAVID\\nD What do you care?\\nC MCCABE\\nD We're just talking. And tonight's\\nD Wednesday night, and I go to Black\\nD Angus for dinner with my daughters\\nD on Wednesday nights, so I'll have\\nD to leave soon. You understand\\nD that our time is limited, don't\\nD you?\\nO 13\\nC DAVID\\nD If I talk, you'll just think I'm\\nD crazy.\\nN McCabe gathers his things.\\nC MCCABE\\nD With all the respect I can offer a\\nD man wearing a latex mask and\\nD spouting conspiracy theories,\\nD David, trust me - you've crossed\\nD that bridge.\\nC DAVID\\nD Fine. Enjoy your dinner.\\nN Somehow the lilt in McCabe's voice draws him closer.\\nC MCCABE\\nD There are five basic emotions in\\nD life. Tell me. what emotion\\nD gripped... him... before he\\nD entered that cell? Was it Guilt?\\nN Shadows. There is no answer, just a rustling and a growing\\nN sense of anticipation in the darkness.\\nC MCCABE\\nD Hate? Shame?\\nN Shadows. Still no answer.\\nC MCCABE\\nD Revenge...\\nD McCabe now shows the invisible skill with which he has\\nD brought his client to the precipice. And now, with one\\nN word, he invites David Aames to look over.\\nC MCCABE\\nD Love?\\nN In the darkness, a rustling and the slight turn of a head.\\nC MCCABE\\nD I'm completely on the wrong track,\\nD aren't I?\\nN INVISIBLE\\nT DISSOLVE TO:\\nO 14\\nS INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT/BACK ROOM OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT\\nN From the darkened back room, David Aames appears with ice,\\nN and re-enters his party.\\nC DAVID\\nD Who needs ice?\\nN Aames moves swirls is more like it - through into his\\nN party, which is nicely underway. Upscale. Modern. Part\\nN literary crowd. Part fashion crowd.       He's great in a\\nN crowd. Surrounded by people, David Aames comes alive.\\nN DAVID MOVES THROUGH PARTY\\nN catching the attention of a model.        (LYNETTE)\\nC LYNETTE\\nD David! Happy Birthday.\\nC DAVID\\nD Jesus, you have the greatest taste\\nD in shoes I've ever seen. Bar\\nD none. Anywhere.\\nN A Woman Caterer in Whites    (EMMA) slips by with a knowing\\nN smile.\\nC EMMA THE CATERER\\nN The old place sure looks more\\nN crowded with people in it.\\nC DAVID\\nD Emma, do you know Lynette?\\nC EMMA THE CATERER\\nD No, but I shudder to think what. we\\nD might have in common.\\nN David notices that Brian Shelby has arrived with a guest, a\\nN Woman who struggles with a package and a very large coat.\\nN On first glance, she's just another girl. On second\\nN glance, she's a killer. He notes her oddly funny behavior.\\nN She removes the coat to reveal a very simple natural\\nN beauty. She is SOFIA SERRANO, a 27 year-old city girl with\\nN a barely containable life-force. Enter PETER BROWN,\\nN David's male assistant with surreptitious headset. He\\nN gestures to a stereo appliance set up in David's living\\nN room.\\nC PETER BROWN\\nD The Living Stereo system is online\\nD and looking great. it's an\\nO 15\\nD amazing prototype. They'd love an\\nD article on it if you like it...\\nN David nods, still focused on Sofia. Suddenly, he finds he\\nN can't take his eyes off her.\\nC PETER BROWN\\nD and happy birthday, sir.\\nS ANGLE ON FRONT ENTRANCE\\nN as David arrives to greet Brian and his guest.\\nC BRIAN\\nD Hey man. Happy birthday and all\\nD the usual shit people say to each\\nD other. How you doing?\\nC DAVID\\nD Livin' the dream, baby. Livin'\\nD the dream.\\nN The two friends hug. David shares a quick glance with\\nN Brian's date, who still burdened with coat.\\nC BRIAN\\nE (to Sofia, as in 'meet the\\nD notorious...')\\nD Meet David Aames.\\nC DAVID\\nE (can't help but flirt)\\nD And to what do I owe this\\nD pleasure, the pleasure of --\\nC SOFIA\\nE (playful)\\nD -- the pleasure of Sofia. Serrano.\\nC BRIAN\\nD We met today at the library, if\\nD you can believe that --\\nC SOFIA\\nD I'm sorry about my coat. It's too\\nD big for your closet.\\nC BRIAN\\nD - we were both pretending to be\\nD intellectuals.\\nC DAVID\\nD No no, I think it's amazing. I\\nD love your coat.\\nO 16\\nC SOFIA\\nD I overdressed. I mean I\\nD underdressed.\\nC BRIAN\\nD I'll just continue like you're\\nD both actually listening to me.\\nC SOFIA\\nE (to David)\\nD Do you have another room to put it\\nD in?\\nC BRIAN\\nE (invisible, re: their chemistry)\\nD I have ceased to exist.\\nC DAVID\\nD Well, Madison Square Garden is\\nD nearby, it might fit there.\\nC SOFIA\\nE (shoves David playfully,\\nE as in touche)\\nD Happy Birthday.\\nN Her upbeat physicality is intoxicating. Sofia hands David\\nN her present.\\nC BRIAN\\nD We picked it out together.\\nD Neither look at Brian. Brian takes a breath. He's been\\nD here before.\\nC DAVID\\nD Thank you.\\nC BRIAN\\nD We picked it out together. We...\\nC SOFIA\\nD Welcome.\\nC BRIAN\\nD Stop flirting and open it.\\nC DAVID\\nD Okay.\\nC BRIAN\\nD Let's get a drink.\\nO 17\\nC SOFIA\\nD Okay.\\nC DAVID\\nD I'll leave this upstairs.\\nN David exits. They are left to consider his personal\\nN charisma.\\nN ANGLE ON A HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY CONNECTED TO STEREO\\nN An odd and disarmingly beautiful display of Coltrane\\nN performing \\\"My Favorite Things\\\" in David's living room.\\nN Sofia passes a hand through Coltrane's image, admires it.\\nC ON DAVID\\nN David is approached by THOMAS TIPP, a Brit, and an\\nN Associate board-member at Aames Publications. Tipp is ten\\nN years older than David, and he is the rarest of birds. A\\nN sentimental lawyer. And at the moment he's a bit drunk.\\nC DAVID\\nD Hey Tommy.\\nN David moves to address him so he can still track Sofia.\\nC TIPP\\nD Hey.  Listen to me. Don't blow\\nD me off. I'm all packed, I'm going\\nD back to London and I understand.\\nD You put me up for that other\\nD attorney's job, so you didn't have\\nD to fire me. A classy move, and\\nD your father would have done the\\nD same ---\\nC DAVID\\nD It's okay, Tommy --\\nC TIPP\\nD I became incompetent. Is there\\nD anything more unbecoming than an\\nD aging mascot? I cared about your\\nD father. I lived and breathed for\\nD him. But these guys, the board,\\nD they think you're stupid.  A\\nD corporate hazard, a rogue.\\nD But the word \\\"stupid\\\" is what David heard loudest of all.\\nN Nearby, we see a Woman Partner          (one of the Seven Dwarves)\\nN taking a quick look at David.\\nO 18\\nC TIPP\\nD But they're going to find a way to\\nD get you out. They're lined up for\\nD your office -\\nN David scans the room. Beneath the good cheer, he sees the\\nN other layer. Lying. Disloyalty. All part of the\\nN institution he enjoys forgetting exists. Each word bashes\\nN his soul.\\nC TIPP\\nD -- your job. Your life. Your\\nD position. They are working day\\nD and night. to cheat you out of your\\nD 51% vote. And they are going to\\nD sell this tradition, this\\nD tradition of words, so they can\\nD eat at a better cafeteria. And\\nD what they don't know is this -\\nE (gestures grandly to\\nE books that surround\\nE them)\\nD - people will read again.\\nN David's gaze falls upon Sofia, who is looking directly at\\nN him. And for one blinding moment, something passes between\\nN them. She looks away. He feels saved.\\nC DAVID\\nE (interrupting with\\nE finality)\\nD I got it.\\nC TIPP\\nD They even have a nickname for you\\nD behind your back.\\nN David smiles faintly. Understandingly.   Tipp kisses him\\nN on the cheek, boldly and drunkenly. He feels like a hero\\nN to himself.\\nC TIPP\\nD Citizen Dildo.\\nN David flinches, just a little.\\nC TIPP\\nD Now you've got great instincts.\\nD But I say this with complete love.\\nD Claim your life... Learn to be an\\nD Asshole... Don't be         -\\nO 19\\nC DAVID\\nE (extracting himself)\\nD Two's enough -\\nC TIPP\\nD Don ' t be-\\nE (immediately)\\nD Okay. Forgive me. I still\\nD believe in this family. Even if\\nD it's only you.\\nN David continues tracking Sofia as he slips over to Peter\\nN Brown.\\nC DAVID\\nD Get Tipp out of here, drive him\\nD home, and in the morning tell him\\nD he's re-hired with a 50% raise.\\nD Set up a meeting with the other\\nD attorneys. I'm going to be in\\nD early tomorrow --\\nE (a look from Peter Brown)\\nD -- earlier than usual.\\nS INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\\nN David enters, shuts the door and sets Sofia's present down.\\nN A party dress is on his bed.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD Hello handsome.\\nN He turns to see Julie Gianni in the bathroom doorway,\\nN wrapped in a comforter.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD I've come to wish you happy\\nD birthday.\\nC DAVID\\nD I didn't invite you, Julie.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD Yeah, that was a little weird -\\nC DAVID\\nD But that's how it works with\\nD parties. You have to be invited.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD I'm mad at you, you dick. We made\\nD love four times the other night.\\nO 20\\nC DAVID\\nD Is that good?\\nC JULIANNA\\nD Two is good. Three is very good.\\nD But four -\\nC DAVID\\nE (fishing for a\\nE compliment)\\nD Four is pretty good?\\nC JULIANNA\\nD No, four is... four is... just\\nD hold me.\\nC DAVID\\nD Four is what?\\nC JULIANNA\\nD Hold me, and then I'll leave, and\\nD you can go talk to that cute\\nD brunette.\\nC DAVID\\nD Four is what?\\nC JULIANNA\\nD I don't want to meet your fancy\\nD friends. I knew 'em all back when\\nD I was fancy too.\\nN He holds her. They talk in between friendly kisses.\\nC DAVID\\nD Four is what?\\nN She pulls away, and talks plainly to him.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD She looks like a moth, David.\\nC DAVID\\nD A moth?\\nC JULIANNA\\nD Sometimes I worry about one of\\nD these clever girls in a big silly\\nD coat who'll play you in just the\\nD right way, and I'll lose my\\nD friend. And there'll be no more\\nD chicken soup parties for you and\\nD me.\\nO 21\\nN She kisses him again. David very gently, and skillfully\\nN resists. She gets the message.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD When will you call me? And don't\\nD say soon. I hate it when you say\\nN \\\"soon.\\\"\\nS INT. PARTY -- NIGHT\\nN Sofia eyes a framed smashed guitar handsomely mounted in a\\nN glass display case.\\nC SOFIA\\nD So this is what's become of rock\\nN and roll. A smashed guitar behind\\nN a glass case displayed on some\\nN rich guy's wall.\\nC DAVID\\nD It was a gift, actually.\\nN She turns and sees it's David, engaging smile in place.\\nN She jumps slightly.\\nC SOFIA\\nE (apologetic)\\nD I like it.\\nN She turns and walks away, David following close behind.\\nC DAVID\\nD Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\nC SOFIA\\nD - how did you get all this stuff,\\nS this apartment, this life -\\nN David is looking just over her shoulder. She turns to see\\nN an almost disturbingly large portrait of David Aames, Sr.\\nN She turns back.\\nC SOFIA\\nD I see.\\nC DAVID\\nD How about if you help me? Unless\\nD I'm horning in here.\\nC SOFIA\\nD You are, but the food's good.\\nO 22\\nC DAVID\\nE (playful, like a spy)\\nD See, I've got a little problem.\\nD I've got a stalker.\\nC SOFIA\\nD It doesn't. sound life-threatening.\\nN Someone passes, bumping her slightly, into him.\\nC DAVID\\nD I need a cover. I need for you to\\nD pretend we're having a\\nD scintillating conversation. And\\nD you're wildly entertained. I know\\nD it's tough.\\nC SOFIA\\nD I'll improvise    -\\nC DAVID\\nD She's right across the room and\\nD she's burning a hole in my back\\nD right now, isn't she?\\nC SOFIA\\nD Red dress, strappy shoes?\\nC DAVID\\nD Yes_\\nC SOFIA\\nE (beat, jarred)\\nD -- wow, she's really staring at\\nD you.\\nC DAVID\\nD Shit.\\nC SOFIA\\nD And she seems to be growing...\\nD less happy.\\nC DAVID\\nD Hmm.\\nC SOFIA\\nD I think she's the saddest girl to\\nD ever hold a martini.\\nN Julie Gianni sits on the steps watching. The girl, and the\\nN dress, looked much happier in the bedroom. Julie rises and\\nN begins to move.\\nO 23\\nS ON BRIAN\\nN Brian holds a drink, attempts to crash a conversation\\nN between two models. His debonair act is shaky.\\nS INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE   -- NIGHT\\nN David and Sofia race up the stairs. Bad kids having fun.\\nC SOFIA\\nD You have another apartment?\\nC DAVID\\nD Sort of a day office. Come on -\\nN They arrive at the door to a smaller upstairs apartment.\\nC SOFIA\\nD I'm not going in there.\\nC DAVID\\nD Well I am. Goodnight.\\nN He enters and shuts the door. Frustrated, she stands for    a\\nN moment, listening to the music streaming from the\\nN downstairs apartment. We watch her private moment as she\\nN decides to leave him, turns, feels the emotional pull,\\nN dances back and knocks sharply three times.\\nC SOFIA\\nD I hear her coming.\\nC DAVID (0.5.)\\nD Really?\\nC SOFIA\\nD No.\\nN David pulls her inside. Shuts the door behind them.\\nS INT. PARTY - NIGHT\\nN Julianna and Brian, both looking for David, discover each\\nN other.\\nS INT. HOME APARTMENT/OFFICE - NIGHT\\nN Artwork on the walls. Sofia is drawn to a powerful\\nN Monet... and it is not a copy.\\nC DAVID\\nD We're safe.      And I've got nothing\\nD to drink...\\nO 24\\nC SOFIA\\nD Who did these paintings?\\nC DAVID\\nD This is Joni Mitchell. This one\\nD is Monet. And this one is done by\\nD me.\\nD (as a tour guide)\\nD It is a snowboard.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Well, two of them are geniuses.\\nE (laughs)\\nC DAVID\\nE (off the Monet)\\nD It's the real thing.

So I drink.\\nC DAVID\\nD Well, we're out of drinks up here.\\nC BRIAN\\nD Here, finish my Jack and Coke.\\nN He messily tries to hand his drink to David, but spills it\\nN embarrassingly. All his cool is gone, and what's left are\\nN his friends covering for him, cleaning up.\\nC DAVID\\nD These stupid glasses        -\\nC BRIAN\\nD No, it's the stupid guy holding\\nD it.\\nO 26\\nC SOFIA\\nE (embarrassed)\\nD Don't worry.

APARTMENT - NIGHT\\nN She switches the light on in an artfully messy city girl\\nN apartment. A life is lived here, a bed on the back-room\\nN floor, a bag of trash on the counter, lamp is askew. She\\nN makes no attempt to clean it up. He soaks in the details,\\nN including some miniature dolls that occupy her kitchen and\\nN shelves.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Hey Paulo!\\nN A large goofy dog comes running at her, and then proceeds\\nN to slather David with love too.\\nC DAVID\\nD I'm glad he protects you.

A note reads: Call Dad!\\nN An odd epiphany occurs as he sees the collage of photos\\nC 30\\nN that represent a hard-working, hard-earned, committed and\\nN passionate life.\\nN Shot moves across the photos. A young girl living a young\\nN girl's hard-working and happy life. Group photos of co-\\nN workers. A few from a vacation. A whole new cast of\\nN characters, all committed, and they all look inviting to\\nN him. And one gloriously random photo of her in Cabo San\\nN Lucas, raising a toast with friends.\\nC DAVID\\nD I like your life.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Well, it's mine and you can't have\\nD it.\\nN David examines a humorously embarrassing vacation photo of\\nN a sloshed Sofia, a guy's arm reaching for her breast.\\nN Dedication reads: To Sergio! Marry me!\\nC DAVID\\nD I do not want to know the story\\nN behind this photo. Who's Sergio?\\nC SOFIA\\nD It's a nickname.\\nC DAVID\\nD Your nickname is Sergio?\\nC SOFIA\\nD It's a long story, and we don't\\nD know each other.\\nC DAVID\\nD So many secrets.\\nC SOFIA\\nD That's because I'm really an arms\\nD dealer.\\nC DAVID\\nD I've never known an arms dealer.\\nC SOFIA\\nD You do now.

But as his best friend, I\\nD also know that he's trying to\\nD finish a novel about inadequacy\\nD and rejection. So the longer I\\nD stay, the better it is for his\\nD career.\\nN Sofia smiles, shakes her head. And yawns.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Your career is one I'd worry\\nD about.\\nN David looks down. She's hit a nerve.\\nC SOFIA\\nD I'm sorry -\\nC DAVID\\nD No, no. You're more right then\\nD you even know. I used to be one\\nD of those guys who was just\\nO 36\\nD snowboarding through his life,\\nN with no focus whatsoever.\\nC SOFIA\\nD When did you change?\\nC DAVID\\nE (pause, confesses)\\nD About five minutes ago.\\nC SOFIA\\nE (direct, slightly\\nE whimsical)\\nD Every passing minute is another\\nD chance to turn it all around.\\nN David shakes his head a little.

David\\nN gently strokes her hair.    Television in b.g. It's one of\\nN those late-night infomercials, and it's ridiculously\\nN compelling. The perfect thing to bond over on a great,\\nN lingering date.\\nC INTERVIEWER ON T.V.\\nD And to those who think that you're\\nD a charlatan?\\nC OLDER MAN ON T.V.\\nD I understand. The perception of a\\nN head frozen somewhere waiting for\\nN reanimation - it sounds like\\nN science fiction.\\nC SOFIA\\nD What are you watching?\\nC DAVID\\nD It's the greatest show... it's\\nD called \\\"Sofia.\\\"\\nN Sofia looks at him and smiles. They look back to the\\nN television.\\nN ON TV INFOMERCIAL\\nN A charming looking older-man discusses eternal life with a\\nN television interviewer.\\nO 37\\nC SOFIA\\nE (off t.v.)\\nD I've seen this thirty times.\\nC DAVID\\nD We did a story on this guy.

It's\\nD safe for Benny. I'm in!\\nN David moves closer to her.\\nC SOFIA\\nD We better watch out.\\nN They regard each other, and David gets up off the sofa.\\nN It's true. The promise is too great to not savor it, and\\nN walk away for now. Thrill remains in the air.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Where are you going?\\nC DAVID\\nD I left my number on your fridge.\\nN He makes a courtly bow and turns. She feels the loss of\\nN his company.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Come here, I want to tell you a\\nD secret.\\nN He pauses a moment, and turns. In this instant, a fleeting\\nN instant, it's the oddest thing. He can see their entire\\nO 38\\nN life together. He returns to her. Tentatively, she grabs\\nN a quick sweet kiss on his mouth. He stays for an extra\\nN moment, kissing just her upper lip, leaving no doubt as to\\nN the potential of their future. And then... very close she\\nN says:\\nC SOFIA\\nD I meant that to be your forehead.\\nN David stands. He looks around the small apartment.\\nC DAVID\\nD Thank you for the inspiration. I\\nD will now attempt to run my\\nD company, showing compassion for\\nD the seething throng of my partners\\nD who root quietly for me to fail.\\nN She looks at him, quite aware of his personal and business\\nN crossroads. Silently, she roots for him like crazy.\\nC DAVID\\nD For things you don't even know -\\nD thank you. I'm going to go to\\nD work. I have a company to run.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Pleasure delayer.\\nN He is still somewhat stunned by the evening, and the girl.\\nN He actually wants to run his company.\\nS EXT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - DAY\\nN David slips out onto the street. It's shabbier than the\\nN alluring night-time version. He'd never notice, or care...\\nN because David is a man with a brand new buzz.                The city is\\nN his. Everything good and great suddenly feels inevitable.\\nN Life feels like a great pop song. Behind him, a car with\\nN its lights still on starts and advances alongside.           Behind\\nN the wheel is Julianna Gianni.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD David Aames.\\nN David leans on his car, turns and shakes his head.\\nC DAVID\\nD Julie Gianni.

You\\nD haven't slept with her because...\\nD it's more fun when you can draw it\\nD out. Sex just isn't as good if\\nD the woman hasn't told all her\\nD friends she'd never sleep with\\nD you.\\nC DAVID\\nD You're right on the money, Julie.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD She must be exhausted from trying\\nD to be witty for you all night\\nD long.\\nC DAVID\\nD Hey, Julie.\\nC JUL IANNA\\nD Sorry. You're just never there\\nD for your friends until they've\\nD already given up on you.\\nC DAVID\\nD I'm not blowing you off!

I missed\\nD an audition and I just felt bad\\nC 40\\nD you didn't invite me to your\\nO party.\\nN It zings him. David turns, considers her.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD Do you want to make it up to me?\\nD I won't tell a soul.\\nN Slowly, he is drawn to her. His old self rallies one last\\nN time. He gets in the car.\\nS INT. JULIANNA'S CAR -- EARLY MORNING\\nN The streets are empty.

Being\\nD with you.\\nN David doesn't look at her. She speeds up, slowly.\\nO 41\\nC JU.LIANNA\\nD One thing bothers me. Why did you\\nD tell Brian I was your fuck-buddy?\\nC DAVID\\nD I didn't tell him that. I didn't\\nD say that.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD When did you stop caring?\\nC DAVID\\nE (watching the road)\\nD About what --\\nC JULIANNA\\nD About the consequences of the\\nD promises you made.\\nC DAVID\\nD Promises         - I thought we had an\\nD understanding.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD Do you know how hard it is to\\nD pretend to be your \\\"buddy?\\\" I\\nD love you, David. You fucked me\\nD four times in one night. You have\\nD been inside me and I have\\nD swallowed your come. That means\\nD something.\\nC DAVID\\nD Julie...\\nC JULIANNA\\nD Four times, David! That means\\nD something. Four times.\\nN He grabs at the wheel.

We'll talk\\nD this out. I want to see where you\\nD live. I want you to stop the car,\\nD Julie. I want you to stop the\\nD car!\\nC JULIANNA\\nD Don't you know, David?

He is paralyzed, unable\\nN to alter his fate.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD Tell me something, David. Do you\\nD believe in God?\\nN Sweet pop music swells. She bursts the barrier of the\\nN winding road, and the car sails into an embankment of a\\nN road below. All sound disappears, as we hear a new kind of\\nN music. Ethereal, almost wondrous. This music continues.\\nT TO BLACK\\nS EXT. CENTRAL PARK - HALL OF TREES - DAY - DREAM\\nN David walks the hall of trees. It's the gentle seductive\\nN whoosh of a new day, the way the world sounds when you're\\nN in love. Vibrant. Alive. Ironically rich in the beauty\\nN we all take for granted when we're not in love. He looks\\nN impossibly drawn forward to Sofia, who stands waiting to\\nN meet him.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Hello.\\nN He steals a kiss. They both feel like they're getting away\\nN with something.\\nC DAVID\\nD You're amazing. Hello.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Did you get to work alright?\\nO 43\\nC DAVID\\nD Yeah, well, actually...

Just another part of the working force.               To our\\nN unseen follower, she is most beautiful when unaware she's\\nN being watched. Shot continues parallel to her. She stops,\\nN sees someone she knows. A truck with several panes of\\nN glass passes by and stops in traffic. Her image blurs\\nN behind the glass, but visible to us in the window is David\\nN Acmes. His healing face is dotted with stubble. He wears\\nN a wool hat. He looks noble, an assembled victim, a modern\\nN miracle. He looks like many things. But he no longer\\nN looks like David Aames. The truck moves through frame.\\nS INT. HOSPITAL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\\nN A dashing-looking surgeon dripping with confidence, DR.\\nN POMERANZ, talks with David.\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nD The cranial structure was based on\\nD thirty pins fastened by small\\nD panels and bits of bone from the\\nD mandible... and it seems the\\nD cartilage grafts have maintained\\nD your cheek structure.\\nD Unfortunately, because you were in\\nD a coma, immediate plastic surgery\\nD was impossible.\\nC DAVID  (V.0.)\\nD Doctors.

POMERANZ\\nD Nobody here takes your feelings\\nD for granted. We did prepare\\nD something for you, based on the\\nD preliminary examination.\\nC DAVID\\nD Tell me. Bring it on.\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nD It's sometimes useful in the early\\nD stages of rejection. It's a\\nD facial prosthetic. It was two\\nD weeks in the making.\\nN The assistant opens a black-leather bound box. In it is\\nN the mask - molded from David's own face, locked into a\\nN pleasant, bland expression.\\nC DAVID\\nD A facial prosthetic.\\nC DR. POMERANZ\\nD The aesthetic replacement does\\nD work.

A few others leave\\nN for the day, trying not to stare at David. Sofia is there\\nN alone. For a moment, we share her solitude. She practices\\nN ballet, twisting and turning and landing in frame, looking\\nN just past camera. She freezes. She catches sight of\\nN David, undisguised. And she begins dancing again. Harder.\\nN Does she even recognize him? He moves closer, attempting\\nN an easy-going persona.

Someone's\\nN camera is fixed on Sofia dancing with Brian, and another\\nN good-looking Young Man. She playfully shoves the good-\\nN looking Young Man away, not unlike the move that won David\\nO 58\\nN over lo those many nights ago at her apartment. He pounds\\nN back another drink.\\nS INT.

Suddenly, he feels\\nN better.\\nS INT. CLUB         - NIGHT\\nN David moves through the crowd, powered by a new sense of\\nN belonging. The music swirls, and takes him along with it.\\nN He dances wildly. In the strobing darkness, he is\\nN anonymous, moving with the group, lost as one. David takes\\nN the mask and pulls it over his head, backwards. In\\nN profile, his two faces stare in opposite directions. David\\nN sees his moment. Sofia is alone near the corner of the\\nN club. He approaches her.\\nC DAVID\\nD Hello again.\\nC SOFIA\\nD Hello again.\\nC DAVID\\nD Idea.

Holding his head in pain, he\\nN manages to run further.\\nN David stops on the street outside her apartment. His sobs\\nN overwhelm him. He drops to the pavement. He passes out,\\nN mouth agape.

Tangled in sheets, they ease\\nN into lovemaking with the perfect fit of two bodies meant\\nN for each other. He gently grabs a handful of her hair.\\nN His hand stops.   It's not Sofia's hair. He slowly turns\\nN her face to his, and we glimpse David over the shoulder of\\nN the woman who is not Sofia. He leaps out of bed, falling\\nN to the floor, the sheet tangled around him.

Tipp opens a file thick with paperwork, two\\nN computer discs and photos. He displays a photo to David,\\nN moving it into the light so he sees it clearly.              Julie\\nN Gianni, battered.\\nC DAVID\\nD This is Julie Gianni. That's not\\nD Sofia. This is Julie Gianni.

POLICE STATION - NIGHT\\nN David strides down the hallway. A Man in a crystal blue\\nN sport coat stands, waiting. As David passes, the Man\\nN confides a single line - as if smuggling out a valuable\\nN secret. Voices from other rooms, including a small child\\nN saying: \\\"Mommy, mommy.\\\"\\nN MAN IN BLUE COAT\\nN This is a revolution of the mind.\\nS INT./EXT.

Brian is one\\nD of them too.\\nC DAVID\\nD You have revealed yourself.\\nC BRIAN\\nD Oh yeah, I'm with them.\\nC DAVID\\nD Where'd you get the coat, Brian?\\nD Where'd you get the camera?

FLORENTINE'S - NIGHT\\nN David nurses a drink, still breathing heavily. He's been\\nN crying. His head aches with this thought - maybe I am\\nN insane. A man in a classy suit walks towards him, inviting\\nN himself to sit at the table. His bedside manner is\\nN impeccable. His smile offers infinite compassion.

It's coming.\\nC MCCABE\\nD Did you kill Sofia?\\nN McCabe stands tall, stunned and curious, still pressing to\\nN pull the nightmare out of him.\\nS INT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - DAY - FLASHBACK\\nN The clown figurine on her stove-top falls over as we hear\\nN the front door kicked in. David enters, slamming the door\\nN behind him. He looks around what was once the site of such\\nN happiness. The same details he'd glimpsed long ago are now\\nN horrifying to him. He looks at a photo on the\\nN refrigerator. The same note: Call Dad! The exact\\nN expression, exact photograph he'd seen on his earlier\\nN visit. Now it is Julie who is in her place.\\nN He opens her drawer. Just some papers. And then... the\\nN drawing he'd once done of her. Now featuring Julie. He\\nN rips up the drawing, and proceeds to destroy the apartment\\nN until he stops, collecting himself. Takes a breath and...\\nN Smash. A lamp is broken over his head. Julie Gianni bends\\nN down to help him. A shard of the lamp-base is still in her\\nN hand. Julie's whole demeanor is that of a different girl.\\nN Even her voice is softer, almost exactly the knock-around\\nN sweetness of Sofia.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD I thought you were a vandal.\\nC DAVID\\nE (with difficulty)\\nD Who... are... you?\\nC JULIANNA\\nD I'm Sofia.\\nC DAVID\\nD You are not Sofia... you're not\\nD Sofia...\\nO 85\\nC JULIANNA\\nD I'm Sofia.\\nC DAVID\\nD Whatever.\\nN Julie starts to cry. Battling tears, she offers her heart\\nN and soul.\\nC JULIANNA\\nD David, honey. This will all be\\nD over soon. We'll be together\\nD again. You'll forget Julianna and\\nD I won't be afraid of you. Let me\\nD get you a cold towel.\\nN She exits. He struggles to rise. His head is a swirling\\nN mess. And then:\\nS ON KITCHEN DOORWAY\\nN Sofia slowly returns with towel. Her image still blurry.\\nN David advances, and faints into her arms.\\nC DAVID\\nD Sofia?\\nC SOFIA\\nE (whispers)\\nD Yes, David, I'm Sofia. I'm Sofia.\\nN He accepts it, all of it, whatever it is, just to hold her.\\nN They kiss, gently, then more powerfully.\\nS INT. SOFIA'S BEDROOM - DAY\\nN They make love, emotionally and deeply. Two bodies\\nN yearning to possess the other. Camera moves across their\\nN bodies, as David wipes frame to black, as the move\\nN continues onto her back.\\nC DAVID\\nD Where were you...\\nN Sofia doesn't answer, doesn't want to lose the moment.\\nC DAVID\\nD I don't want to know.\\nE (thrusting)\\nD Just tell me you love me.\\nN David keeps his face buried in her shoulder'. He doesn't\\nN want to look. The passion gives way to a mounting dread,\\nN as he hears a voice almost like Sofia's.\\nO 86\\nC JULIANNA (O.S.)\\nD I love you. I'm afraid of how\\nD powerful this is.\\nN He continues moving passionately, harder now. Julie\\nN responds to the overwhelming surge within David. She gives\\nN over to the waves of dark pleasure, riding him like a\\nN rocket. from hell. Harder now. Grabbing her hands and\\nN pulling them high above her head, clamping down with his\\nN own.\\nN Julie Gianni cries a deep, guttural sound of passion.\\nN This is what someone sounds like when they're not faking\\nN it. And then... slam... a pillow comes down over her face.\\nC DAVID\\nN What the fuck is happening?\\nN Julie begins to react to what is clearly no longer an\\nN advanced lovemaking session.\\nC DAVID\\nD I want to see your face!\\nN She grabs at the pillow.\\nC DAVID\\nD I want to see your face!\\nN David reaches orgasm, sobbing, recklessly out of control.\\nN Julie's body stops kicking and settles into silence. He\\nN loosens the pillow, and is rewarded with one last violent\\nN attempt at life. Her hand smacks his neck. He's so taut\\nN it bounces off. She grabs at his face one last time, her\\nN hand is left with enough power only to caress his face.\\nN She goes limp. Silence. David's crying turns to a\\nN whimper. He looks at the pillow over Julie's head. He's\\nN confused, a puddle of jagged adrenaline. He doesn't want\\nN to remove the pillow for fear of who could be underneath.\\nN He rises up, his elbow across her lifeless chest. With\\nN true horror, he knows he has to move his hand, but his hand\\nN will reveal who he's just killed.\\nN ON HER TORSO\\nN as his arm moves inexorably away from her chest. Quarter-\\nN inch by quarter-inch he inches it downward, across the top\\nN of her breasts... dreading the inevitable, not seeing it,\\nN and then... there it is. The mole between her breasts.\\nS INT. HALLWAY STAIRS - DAY\\nN David exits hurriedly, past some tenants, down the stairs.\\nN He looks up at his own reflection in the hallway mirror.\\nO 87\\nN He looks horribly disfigured. We hear the sound of\\nN breathing, encased in a mask.\\nS INT. PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - NIGHT -  (INTERROGATION # 4)\\nN McCabe sits across from David. McCabe looks away, haunted\\nN by the admission of guilt.\\nC DAVID\\nD I did it, didn't I? I don't...\\nD feel... like I killed someone.

I don't want to give up on\\nD you.\\nN David looks at, him oddly. Suddenly, the archetype seems\\nN very familiar.

David sits at. the table as McCabe and Aaron\\nN exit. He hears Aaron's television; it's the Life Extension\\nN Infomercial.\\nS INT. AARON'S CUBICLE - NIGHT\\nN Through the glass of the psychiatric unit, we see McCabe\\nN and Aaron exit. Only Aaron's television, sitting on a\\nN stool, remains. Push in on the television, which is\\nN playing the L.E. Infomercial.\\nN Push in on the reverse. It's David at the window as he\\nN realizes the true meaning of \\\"Ellie\\\" -- L.E. He bangs on\\nN the glass, at first slow, then faster, yelling for McCabe.\\nN The L.E. Infomercial and Benny the Dog are reflected on the\\nN window.\\nO 89\\nC DAVID\\nD McCABE!!! McCABE!!!

ELEVATOR - DAY\\nN The compartment hurtles upwards, rising higher than the\\nN surrounding buildings.\\nC VENTURA\\nD This was a kind woman, an\\nD individual, more than your equal.\\nN Ventura nods wistfully. He fell in love with her a little,\\nD too.\\nO 100\\nC VENTURA\\nD You barely knew her in real life,\\nD but. in your Lucid Dream, she was\\nD your savior.\\nS ON DAVID - SLIGHT PUSH\\nN trying to remember, feeling the flashes of truth in brief\\nN moments. And then a bracing, challenging realization that\\nN something went wrong.\\nC DAVID\\nD What happened in my real life?\\nD Something happened. What did you\\nD erase?\\nC VENTURA\\nD Do you really want to know?\\nN HIGH ANGLE SHOT OF DAVID\\nN almost nauseous\\nC DAVID\\nD Tell me everything.\\nS EXT. NIGHTCLUB STREET - DAY\\nN Match push in on David rising to his feet. His disfigured\\nN face thunders with a massive migraine. The exact. shot we\\nN once saw as David and Sofia walked away together. This\\nN time, David is alone.\\nC VENTURA\\nD The morning after the nightclub,\\nD you woke up on that street, hung-\\nD over and along. You got up and\\nD walked away. You never saw Sofia\\nD again.\\nC DAVID\\nD I didn't kill Sofia.\\nC VENTURA\\nD No.\\nS ON DAVID - IN ELEVATOR\\nN He can't remember any of this. And then...\\nC VENTURA\\nD You battled your board, the Seven\\nD Dwarves, for control. In the end\\nD it was Thomas Tipp, your father's\\nO 101\\nD friend, the one whose job you\\nD saved, who wrenched the company\\nD back in your control.\\nS INT. RISE PUBLICATIONS - DAY - FLASHBACK\\nN David exits the company elevator and returns to Aames\\nN Publications.

DAVID'S APARTMENT      - NIGHT\\nN David sits in front of the computer in bad physical shape.\\nC VENTURA\\nD You longed for Sofia. You shut\\nD yourself away for months. You\\nD were alone. You couldn't take the\\nD pain anymore. Headaches... you\\nD could barely function.\\nC DAVID\\nD I found you on the Internet. I\\nD signed the contract with you. And\\nD then...\\nS INT. MOTEL --- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK\\nN Aames takes pills, collapses. Music plays.\\nN PUSH INTO CLOSE UP ON DAVID IN ELEVATOR\\nC DAVID\\nD I remember...\\nN It comes back to him, powerfully.\\nC DAVID\\nD Somebody died.

DAVID'S APARTMENT -- MEMORIAL - DAY\\nN Friends and family clog the old apartment.

DAVID'S APARTMENT - DAY\\nN Sofia ventures into David's apartment alone, taking in the\\nN environment and remembering the best moments of her brief\\nN encounter with David.\\nC VENTURA\\nD You were missed, David.\\nN She moves into close-up, and we see the wonder and the joy\\nN of a perfect love, nearly attained. She soaks in the\\nN beautiful, painful mystery of life.\\nC VENTURA\\nD It was Sofia who never fully\\nD recovered. It was she who somehow\\nD knew you best. And like you, she\\nD never forgot that one night where\\nD real, true love seemed possible.\\nS FLASHBACK - DAY\\nN David contemplates getting into the car with Julianna.

There's\\nD nothing bigger, is there?\\nS EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY\\nN David and Ventura exit the elevator onto the rooftop.\\nC VENTURA\\nD Your subconscious did create\\nD problems. Your dream turned into\\nD a nightmare. The glitch has been\\nO corrected.\\nC DAVID\\nD So all I have to do is imagine\\nD something? If I wanted McCabe to\\nD come back, right now -\\nN McCabe comes flying out of the door.\\nC MCCABE\\nD David. Listen to me. These\\nD people are dangerous. We're in\\nD trouble. We need to get off this\\nD roof now.\\nM MCC DAVID\\nN Who turns from McCabe to Ventura.\\nN Ventura leads David away.\\nC VENTURA\\nD We're now on \\\"pause\\\". And you're\\nD about to return to your Lucid\\nD Dream...\\nC MCCABE\\nD \\\"Pause\\\"?\\nC VENTURA\\nE (continuing)\\nD .. with all of the upgrades. You\\nD won't remember any of this, nor be\\nD charged for the technical support.\\nD it is now your moment of choice.\\nD You can return to your Lucid\\nD Dream, and live a beautiful life\\nO 104\\nC with Sofia, or whomever you\\nD wish... or you can choose the\\nD world out there.\\nN Ventura gestures to the city beyond, as they come to a\\nN halt.\\nC CLOSE ON DAVID\\nC DAVID\\nD The world out. there. And you can\\nD bring me back, just. like Benny the\\nD Dog.\\nC CLOSE ON VENTURA\\nD The client is starting to understand.\\nC VENTURA\\nD Yes. Just like Benny the Dog.\\nD Your face and body can now be\\nD fixed, of course. But it's very\\nD different out there now. Your\\nD finances won't last long. Your\\nD panel of observers are waiting for\\nD you to choose.\\nN Ventura gestures into the camera. He begins walking\\nN backwards to the roof's ledge.\\nC VENTURA\\nD There are no guarantees. But\\nD remember, even in the future, the\\nD sweet is never as sweet without\\nD the sour.\\nN David sees that Brian Shelby has now joined McCabe on the\\nN roof. He nods to Brian, who nods back.\\nC DAVID\\nD How do I wake up?\\nC VENTURA\\nD The decision is yours.\\nN Ventura glances over the edge.\\nC DAVID\\nD And I chose this scenario, didn't\\nD I?\\nO 105\\nC VENTURA\\nE (enjoying that he\\nE understands)\\nD Yes, to face your last remaining\\nD fear of heights.\\nC MCCABE\\nD David, don't listen to him. You\\nD were right. This is the Seven\\nD Dwarves. It's a set up! You\\nD can't trust him.\\nN David looks at McCabe with compassion.\\nC VENTURA\\nD Don't feel bad, David. This\\nD winning man is your creation.\\nD It's in his nature to fight for\\nD his existence. But he's not real.\\nC CLOSE ON DAVID\\nD who looks on with compassion.\\nN McCabe fights for himself.\\nC MCCABE\\nD I'm real. I have two daughters.\\nD You know that.\\nC VENTURA\\nD What are their names?\\nC MCCABE\\nD I    - I --\\nC CLOSE ON DAVID\\nN who feels for McCabe as the apparition crumbles.\\nC MCCABE\\nD Mortality as home entertainment.\\nD This cannot be the future. Can\\nD it?\\nN David regards McCabe. Once dynamic, McCabe now seems\\nN unsure of his own existence. Slowly, always looking at\\nN David, he settles into the truth of his very being. With\\nN great nobility, McCabe shoves his hands into his pockets\\nN and faces his own destiny... or lack thereof.\\nC MCCABE\\nE (quietly)\\nD Goodbye.\\nO 106\\nC VENTURA\\nD It's been a brilliant journey of\\nD self-awakening, and you've simply\\nD got to ask yourself -- what is\\nD happiness to you?\\nN CLOSE PUSH IN ON DAVID AAMES\\nN His moment of realization.\\nC DAVID\\nD I want to live a real life. I\\nD don't want to dream any longer.\\nC VENTURA\\nD Any last wishes?\\nC DAVID\\nD Let them out there read my mind.\\nC VENTURA\\nD I wish you well, David.\\nN Music rises as he turns to see Sofia. He moves to her.\\nN She touches his cheek. His face is restored. They\\nN embrace.\\nC DAVID\\nD Look at us. I'm frozen, and\\nD you're dead. And I love you.\\nC SOFIA\\nD It's a problem.\\nC DAVID\\nD I lost you when I got in that car.\\nD I'm sorry.\\nN She looks at him, beguiling and understanding.\\nC DAVID\\nD But remember what you told me\\nD once? Every passing minute is\\nD another chance to turn it all\\nN around.\\nN She kisses him.\\nC SOFIA\\nD I'll find you again.\\nN She regards her lost love, taking him in. David treasures\\nN his last moments with her.\\nO 107\\nN David takes a breath and begins backing to the ledge.\\nC DAVID\\nD I'll see you in another life when\\nD we are both cats.\\nN David backs up and begins to run. He arrives at the edge,\\nN looking down at the distance to the ground, stopping\\nN himself at the precipice.\\nN He looks back to Sofia one last time, and then leaps out\\nN into the celestial future. For a fraction of a moment, he\\nN is suspended in mid-air. And he hurtles to the ground.\\nN And the ground hurtles to meet him.\\nN SERIES OF IMAGES\\nN It is the little things, the random poetic instances of\\nN David Aames' life that come back to him. Music rises as he\\nN realizes, finally, his own true poetry and humanity. The\\nN images topple onto each other with the rhythm of his\\nN heartbeat. Father. Mother. A casual glance of a\\nN stranger. All combine to give his life meaning. And then,\\nN finally, we see the face of the one person who gave him\\nN purpose in this life... and the next. Sofia.\\nN TO WHITE:\\nN The sound of a breath. A gulp of life. Someone's heart is\\nN beating.\\nC A WOMAN'S VOICE\\nD Relax... relax, David... open your\\nN eyes...\\nN An eye opens and the pupil darts to the right and left.\\nN Life again.\\nN A WOMAN'S VOICE\\nN open your eyes.\\nN THE END\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bechdel_rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
