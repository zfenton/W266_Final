#### Automating the Bechdel Test ####

The Bechdel Test is a simple test for checking the bias of a movie. It has three rules that need to be met to pass the test:

1. The movie must contain at least two __named__ female characters.
2. Two of the named female characters need to speak with eachother.
3. They must speak about something other than a man.

The Bechdel test was originally created by Alison Bechdel. It appeard in a comic stop titled "The Rule" that was published in 1985. A great article on the test can be found [here](https://lithub.com/read-the-1985-comic-strip-that-inspired-the-bechdel-test/).
