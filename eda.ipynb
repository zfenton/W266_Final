       "'T 12 YEARS A SLAVE D Written by C John Ridley T CARD: 1841 T FADE IN: S 1 INT. TOWNHOUSE/STUDY - DAY 1 S -EARLY APRIL, 1841- N We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A N FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS. N WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN. It\\'s not a high N end piece, but it is quite nice. N WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair N with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late N twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner, N is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual. N Someone who has known manual labor in his time. N Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing N the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to N play vigorously. As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO: S INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING N We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being N thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In N attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are N FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women N are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense N that for the most part they are people of means. N The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At N the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a N REEL. N The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon, N having cut directly from the tune he was previously N playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no N way seems possessed with empty servitude. N Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into N enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal N thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear N that despite their respective races there is much N admiration and appreciation for Solomon\\'s abilities. S INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING N It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is N ANNE; Solomon\\'s wife, a few years younger than he. We N see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and N ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed N kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes, O (CONTINUED) O 2. O 3 CONTINUED: 3 N she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if N preparing to pose for a portrait. N They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer. N He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY N stressed. It isn\\'t that he doesn\\'t have love for them, N he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his N greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and N well and provided for. He goes to his children, and N hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss N on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight. S EXT. STREET - DAY N Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets C and groves of Saratoga. D The streets are well populated this morning with many N people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are N BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly N easily - though not always completely - with the whites. N We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their N WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south N and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are N not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are N well dressed and \"leading apparently an easy life\" - N comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters. N As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an N intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart N traffic. Solomon and his children easily jump across the N muck. Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for N Solomon to help her across. C ANNE D Solomon... N Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile N waving her forward: C SOLOMON D Come, Anne. Jump. N The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on. C ALONZO MARGARET D Jump. You can make it. I\\'ve done it. You can make D it. C ANNE D I will not ruin my dress. Catch D me! N Solomon moves close, holds out his arms. Yet, there\\'s N still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes. Anne N gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon N replies. O (CONTINUED) O 3. C SOLOMON D I will catch you, Anne. E (BEAT) D I will. N Again, lightly stern: C ANNE D You will. N And with that Anne takes the leap. Solomon catches her, N swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to N the delighted applause of the children. That done, N Solomon takes Anne\\'s hand and leads her on. N As Solomon and his family make their way, among the N slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER. N As he trails his MASTER he can\\'t help but note Solomon N and his family as they enter A STORE. His intrigue of N this most handsome and harmonious group should be N obvious. N With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the N STORE. Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly. N Suddenly a voice barks out- N A VOICE (O.S.) D Jasper! Come on! S INT. STORE - LATER N We are inside the store of MR. CEPHAS PARKER; a white man N and a supplier of general goods. Solomon greets him N WITH: C SOLOMON D Mr. Parker. C PARKER D Mr. Northup. Mrs. Northup. D With money in hand the Northup children move quickly N about the store looking for items to purchase. O CONTINUED: N Anne looks over some silks and fabrics. Parker suggests O TO SOLOMON: C PARKER (CONT\\'D) D A new cravat, Solomon? Pure silk D by way of the French. C SOLOMON D We are in need of a fresh carry D all for the Mrs\\'s travels. C PARKER D A year\\'s passed? Off to Sandy C Hill? C ANNE D I am. N Using a long pole, Mr. Parker fetches down a CARRY ALL N from an upper shelf. C PARKER D Something to suit your style, but D sturdy enough for the forty miles D round trip. N Handing the Bag to Anne, she is immediately taken by it. C ANNE D It\\'s beautiful. C SOLOMON E (CAUTIOUSLY) D At what price? C ANNE D We will take it. Children, come D see what your father has just D purchased for me. N As the children run over - chattering excitedly about the N new gift - they RUN PAST JASPER who has quietly entered N the store. N At the checkout counter sits a portrait of WILLIAM HENRY N HARRISON, the edges draped in black crepe. Before the N book sits a LEDGER. Mr. Parker asks of Solomon: C PARKER D If you would sign our condolence D book. My hope is to find a way to D forward it to the Widow Harrison. D Sad days for the nation. C SOLOMON D Yes, certainly. Poor Mrs. Harris D and her children. I hope brighter D times ahead. O (CONTINUED) O 4A. O 5 CONTINUED: (2) 5 N Jasper looks scared, timid. It\\'s as though he\\'d like to N engage, but is unsure of as to how. Noting Jasper, Parker N SAYS: C PARKER D A moment, sir, and you will be D assisted. C SOLOMON D If we could discuss the price... O (CONTINUED) O 5. O 5 CONTINUED: (3) 5 C PARKER D Forgive me, Mrs. Northup. A D customer waits. Welcome, sir. D To Jasper, with good nature: C SOLOMON D Shop well, but mind your wallet. C PARKER D Ignore the gentleman\\'s nonsense. D Now, may I interest you in a new D cravat? Pure silk by way of the-- N Before Parker can finish, the door opens. It\\'s Jasper\\'s N Master, FITZGERALD. He\\'s stern, clearly displeased. C FITZGERALD D Jasper! E (TO PARKER) D My regrets for the intrusion. C SOLOMON D No intrusion. N Fitzgerald looks to Solomon. It is a cold glare as N though he wasn\\'t speaking to, and has no interest in a N response from a black man. Looking back to Parker: C FITZGERALD D Good day, sir. O 6 6 S INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/DINING ROOM - EVENING N Anne, busy in the kitchen, puts the final touches to the N meal, which is just about to begin. Solomon, in the N meanwhile, sits at the head of the table reading from a N NEWSPAPER. He reads to his children solemn news of the N funeral arrangements for the recently deceased President N Harrison. C SOLOMON D \"Thus has passed away from earth D our late President.\" D Solomon starts from the top of the article. C SOLOMON (CONT\\'D) D \"During the morning, from sunrise, D the heavy bells had been pealing D forth their slow and solemn toll D while the minute guns announced D that soon the grave would receive D its trust. Our city as well as D our entire nation has been called D to weep over the fall of a great D and good man. One who was by the D wishes of a large majority of our E (MORE) (CONTINUED) O 5A. O 6 CONTINUED: 6 C SOLOMON (CONT\\'D) D people raised to fill the highest D place of trust within their gift. D William Henry Harrison.\" N A long moment of quiet, the family continuing to eat. D Then, from Margaret: C MARGARET D Will you read it again? C ANNE D Not just now, darling. N Anne enters the dining room and places a large chicken at N the center of the table. As she takes a seat, all heads N are bowed. C MARGARET D For food that stays our hunger, D For rest that brings us ease, D For homes where memories linger, D We give our thanks for these. M ALL D Amen. C SOLOMON D Margaret, that was wonderful. C MARGARET D Thank you, Papa. C SOLOMON D Alonzo, do you have something to D say? C ALONZO D Yes, I helped Momma make this. C ANNE D Yes, and you were such a good D help. Especially making the gravy. C MARGARET D Papa, I would very much like to D learn how to play the violin. D Could you teach me? C ALONZO D Me too! C MARGARET D Yes, but I asked Papa first. C SOLOMON D Both of you, calm down. We will D have our first lesson after this D wonderful dinner. And on that D note, let\\'s start eating. O (CONTINUED) O 5B. O 6 CONTINUED: (2) 6 N The family all tuck in to their meal. The scene is one of N warmth and happiness. O 6. S 7 INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - NIGHT 7 N Solomon and Anne have fun and difficulty putting the N unruly children to bed. They are tucked in, and each N given a kiss good night. As Margaret lays down to sleep, N Anne blows out the candle darkening the room. N Silhouetted in the doorway, Solomon takes Anne in his N arms, holds her tightly as they both luxuriate in the N simple, beautiful gift that is their children. C 7A 7A S INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - NIGHT N Now alone together, we see Anne and Solomon wrapped in N each other\\'s arms. Beyond being physically close, N emotionally close, they are just so very comfortable with N one another. They are the very representation of a N couple who are made for each other. N They look at each other for a prolonged time. C SOLOMON E (COMICALLY FORLORN) D Three weeks. Two days. C ANNE D It is the custom. I wonder what D you\\'ll do without me? C SOLOMON D I won\\'t stay idle. N SOLOMON\\'s eyes lower. C ANNE D Darling, it\\'s good money. C SOLOMON D If only I didn\\'t have to share D your cooking with other people. N ANNE holds his gaze. C ANNE D You don\\'t. N They kiss. O 8 OMIT 8 O 7. S 9 EXT. NORTHUP HOUSE - MORNING 9 N We are just outside the Northup house. A CARRIAGE waits N with a DRIVER. Anne and the children are dressed for N travel - Anne sporting HER NEW CARRY ALL. The Driver N loads bags into the carriage. N For her parting gift, Anne gives her husband a kiss. C SOLOMON D Travel safely. C ANNE D Stay safely. N Anne and the children loaded up, the Driver chides the N horse and the carriage heads off. Solomon waves a hearty N good bye to his wife and children. O 10 10 S EXT. PARK - DAY N Solomon is now out for a stroll. He passes two men - two N in particular - who stand outside conversing with MR. N MOON himself: MERRILL BROWN and ABRAM HAMILTON. Brown N is about 40, with a countenance indicating shrewdness and N intelligence. Hamilton is closer to 25, a man of fair N complexion and light eyes. Both are finely, if perhaps a N bit garishly, dressed. Hamilton, as Solomon describes N him, slightly effeminate. N Moon, spotting Solomon: C MR. MOON D Call the Devil\\'s name... There he D is now. Mr. Northup...! I have D two gentlemen who should make your D acquaintance. Messrs. Brown and D Hamilton. C BROWN D Sir. D MR. MOON D Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen D were inquiring about distinguished D individuals, and I was just this D very moment telling them that D Solomon Northup is an expert D player on the violin. C HAMILTON D He was indeed. C SOLOMON D Mr. Moon is being overly gracious. O (CONTINUED) O 8. O 10 CONTINUED: 10 C BROWN C Taking into consideration his D graciousness and your modesty, may D we trouble you for a moment of D your time to converse, sir? O 11 11 S EXT. PARK/PAVILION - LATER N We make a jump to a green space. Solomon, Brown and N Hamilton are sitting at a bench. C SOLOMON D A circus? C HAMILTON D That is our usual employee. The D company currently in the city of D Washington. C BROWN D Circus too constricting a word to D describe the talented and merry D band with which we travel. It is D a spectacle unlike most have ever D witnessed. Creatures from the D darkest Africa as yet unseen by D civilized man. Acrobats from the D Orient able to contort themselves N in the most confounding manners. C HAMILTON D And I myself in aide of Mr. Brown; D an internationally renowned D practitioner in the art of D prestidigitation. C BROWN D We are on our way thither to D rejoin the company having left for D a short time to make a small D profit from our own exhibitions. C HAMILTON D The reason for our inquiry with D Mr. Moon... C BROWN D Yes. We had just a devil of a D time in procuring music for our E (MORE) O (CONTINUED) O 9. O 11 CONTINUED: 11 C BROWN (CONT\\'D) D entertainments. Men of true D talent seemingly in short supply. C SOLOMON D Thank you sir... C BROWN D If we could persuade you to D accompany us as far as New York... D We would give you one dollar for D each day\\'s service and three D dollars for every night played at D our performances. In addition we D would provide sufficient pay for D the expenses of your return from D New York here to Saratoga. C SOLOMON D You understand this is all very D sudden. C HAMILTON D Consider it an opportunity to see D THE COUNTRY-- C SOLOMON D It\\'s intriguing... C HAMILTON D If there is any way in which you D would give consideration to the D offer... N Solomon gives the whole deal one last consideration. C SOLOMON D The payment offered is enticement D enough, as is my desire to visit D the metropolis. C HAMILTON D We are delighted, sir. So D delighted. Though we would add D that our travel plans-- C BROWN D We would like to depart with D haste. O (CONTINUED) O 10. O 11 CONTINUED: (2) 11 C SOLOMON D As luck would have it, my wife and D children are traveling. I will D write her of our plans. C BROWN D Excellent! I would beg you D collect yourself, then we may O proceed. O 12 12 S INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - LATER N Back in his house, we see Solomon packing: putting some N clothes in a travel case, and collecting his violin as N well. S 13 INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/STUDY - LATER 13 N Solomon sits down to write a letter; pen poised over N paper with already a few lines written. But Solomon N thinks better of it. WITH LITTLE THOUGHT HE TEARS THE N PAPER AND SETS IT ASIDE. WE SHOULD GET THE SENSE THAT N THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE BY LETTER N IS LOST ON SOLOMON. THIS FACT WILL HAVE GREAT WEIGHT IN N THE NEAR FUTURE. O 14 14 S EXT. SOLOMON\\'S HOUSE/INT. COVERED CARRIAGE - LATER N Solomon enters the buggy, carpet bag in hand. Brown and N Hamilton are waiting. They ride in a covered carriage N led by a pair of \"noble\" horses. C HAMILTON D No letter to post? C SOLOMON D No need. My return will coincide D with my family\\'s. C BROWN D We\\'re off then. O 15 15 S INT. PUB - EVENING S -MID TO LATE APRIL, 1841- N We find ourselves in a roadside pub. It serves the N purpose of drinking and diversion, and little more. As N Solomon plays his violin, Brown and Hamilton perform a N decent, paired magic routine before a SPARSE AUDIENCE NOT N OF \"SELECT CHARACTER.\" O 11. S 16 INT. PUB - LATER 16 D After the show, the pub now fairly empty, Solomon, N Hamilton and Brown sit down to eat. Hamilton and Brown N drink, but again Solomon abstains. Though Solomon N remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of N being disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little N money was collected. C HAMILTON D Not an additional tip from a one D of them. They expect to be D entertained for nothing. C BROWN D And not satisfied a bit despite D giving them more than what they O paid for. C SOLOMON D It\\'s the national mood. There\\'s D too much grief to make room for D frivolity. C HAMILTON D My sincerest apologies, Solomon. D You were promised opportunity, and D you were given none. C BROWN D The opportunity is with the D circus. A two man show poorly D promoted, what were we to expect? D But the circus bills itself. C HAMILTON D True. C BROWN D I have told you of the circus with D which we are connected. Creatures D from the darkest of Africa. D Acrobats from the Orient who-- C SOLOMON D You have described it, yes. C BROWN D Yes. We need to return D immediately to Washington. C Solomon...I believe us familiar D enough now, but forgive me if I am D bold...would you consider making D the trip with us? N Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea. O (CONTINUED) O 12. O 16 CONTINUED: 16 C HAMILTON D Entertaining at pubs and inns has D it\\'s place, but a man of your D skills deserves better. C BROWN D Hear, hear. C HAMILTON D And more importantly you would D build your own name and following. D The circus tends to attract those D with the highest of reputations. D An introduction here and there D could amount to a lifetime of D reward. Now would be the time. D With your family away, an D opportunity presents itself. C BROWN D Said as fellow artists as well as D businessmen. Well worth the D effort at least. C SOLOMON D You present a flattering D representation. As my family will D be traveling back shortly, perhaps D I might commit only to one trial D engagement. C HAMILTON D Oh, very good, sir. Very good. I D cannot recall being so excited. C BROWN D There is a practical concern. If D you are to continue on with us you D should obtain your free papers. C SOLOMON D Not necessary. C BROWN D Here in New York, no. But we will D be entering slave states and as a D matter of precaution... It\\'s to D all our benefit we should not have D to come to account for your well D being. C HAMILTON D Six shillings worth of effort D could well save much trouble D later. O (CONTINUED) O 12A. O 16 CONTINUED: (2) 16 C BROWN D We\\'ll go to the Customs House in D the morning, then travel on. Good D business all around. O 13. O 17 OMIT 17 S 18 EXT. WASHINGTON - DAY 18 S The city is a swarm of people. At the moment the populace N is displaying both sorrow and anticipation. Sorrow for N the loss of the President. Many are dressed in black, N and black crepe hangs nearly everywhere. Black armbands N are frequently seen, and the occasional American Flag N hung at half mast. As well, there are portraits of N Harrison at varying locations. N Having arrived in Washington, Solomon, Hamilton and Brown N RIDE ONWARD IN THEIR CARRIAGE. O 19 19 S INT. GADSBY HOTEL/DINNING ROOM - EVENING N A decent though crowded, boisterous and smoke-filled N joint. Very lively. Solomon, Hamilton and Brown are N among several parties drinking in the hotel\\'s bar. As N with seemingly everywhere in the city black crepes N accessorize the background. Brown counts out $43.00 IN N COIN on the tabletop. Solomon is astonished by the N amount. C BROWN D Forty-three dollars. All to you. C SOLOMON D That...it\\'s far more than my wages D amount to. C BROWN D Consider the remainder an advance D from the circus. I cannot tell D you...I honestly wish you had seen D the expression of our director D when I described your abilities. N He was fairly overcome with N excitement. C HAMILTON D You should have invited him to sup D with us. C BROWN D I did. I did, but so many D preparations before the company is N to depart. C SOLOMON D GENTLEMEN-- C BROWN D Tomorrow we shall prepare for our D Washington debut. But tonight, our D thoughts are with the great man E (MORE) (CONTINUED) O 13A. O 19 CONTINUED: 19 C BROWN (CONT\\'D) D for whom this city prepared solemn D memorial. He has passed from the D praise of men to receive the D plaudit of his heavenly father. A D fine man has passed. Let us D remember him with a drink. O (CONTINUED) O 14. O 19 CONTINUED: (2) 19 N Both Hamilton and Brown hold up their tankards to drink. N Solomon, a bit reluctantly, does the same. C HAMILTON D Cheers. C BROWN D Another. Our departed President D deserves all the salutation we can D imbibe. N Hamilton and Brown drink again, and Solomon does as well. O 20 20 C OMIT O 21 OMIT 21 S 22 EXT. ALLEY - LATER 22 N WE MAKE A HARD CUT to Solomon outside of the Pub, in an N alley, with Brown and Hamilton in silhouette, back-lit by N the street lights. He is violently ill, hunched over and N retching horribly. C HAMILTON D That\\'s all right Solomon. No D shame in it. No shame at all. O 15. S A23 INT. GADSBY HOTEL - STAIRCASE A23 N Hamilton and Brown help Solomon to lumber up the spiral N staircase, passing the occasional bemused guest. S 23 INT. GADSBY HOTEL/SOLOMON\\'S ROOM - NIGHT 23 N Hamilton is placing a spittoon near Solomon\\'s bed, where N a prone and reeling Solomon lays. Hamilton sits on the N bed. As he strokes Solomon\\'s sweaty face, Hamilton N speaks sweetly. C HAMILTON D I\\'m afraid that Brown and I D haven\\'t brought you much luck. D But rough waters bring smooth D sailing. Eventually they do. C SOLOMON D ....So...so sorry... C HAMILTON D Shhh. We won\\'t hear it. We D won\\'t. C BROWN D Let him sleep. C HAMILTON D Hmm. A good night\\'s sleep. And D tomorrow...tomorrow you will feel D as well and refreshed as though D the earth were new again. N Hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to N Solomon for Brown\\'s taste. With more than a bit of N SIGNIFICATION: C BROWN D Hamilton! Nothing more we can do D for him. C HAMILTON D Such is the pity. N Displaying an odd sort of disappointment, Hamilton slinks N away from the bed. He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A N CANDLE. The room goes dark with a blackness more than N night. Brown and Hamilton exit. Solomon lays in the N dark and moans. His sounds becoming MORE AND MORE N DISTRESSED. O 24 24 S INT. BURCH\\'S DUNGEON - DAWN O (CONTINUED) O 16. O 24 CONTINUED: 24 N Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new N circumstances. He finds himself in a nearly lightless S room about twelve feet square with walls of solid N masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small N window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only N furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box N stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are N CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and N his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But N that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic. N He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He N does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails N about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and N beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams N without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his N flesh, but he cannot pull himself free. N After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires, N slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed N state he remains. O 25 25 S INT. BURCH\\'S DUNGEON - MORNING N Solomon again awakens. He hears sounds beyond the N door...footsteps. Eventually the door opens. Enter N JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER N RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer. N As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into N the otherwise near-black room. The shine is painful to N Solomon\\'s eyes. With no salutation whatsoever, Burch N ASKS: C BURCH D Well, my boy, how yah feel now? N Solomon rises up as best he can. With all the resolve he D can put together he states what he considers to be fact: C SOLOMON D I am Solomon Northup. I am a free D man; a resident of Saratoga, New D York. The residence also of my D wife and children who are equally D free. I have papers. You have no D right whatsoever to detain me-- C BURCH D Yah not any-- C SOLOMON D And I promise you - I promise - D upon my liberation I will have D satisfaction for this wrong. C BURCH D Resolve this. Produce your D papers. O (CONTINUED) O 17. O 25 CONTINUED: 25 N With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his N trousers. He searches one, then the other, but they are N empty. He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his N papers have been lifted. Solomon\\'s confidence shifts, N but to resolve rather than fear. Papers or none, he will N not be easily cowed. Still, Burch asserts: C BURCH (CONT\\'D) D Yah no free man. And yah ain\\'t D from Saratoga. Yah from Georgia. N A moment. Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon N and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man N yielding. Burch says again: C BURCH (CONT\\'D) D Yah ain\\'t a free man. Yah nuthin\\' D but a Georgia runaway. N Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce. Solomon does not N in any way. Both men exchange a long and daring stare. N The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off. Burch, N leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT N DISTINGUISH. N Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of N \"instruments:\" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is N about the size in circumference of two open hands, and N bored with a small auger in numerous places. He also N carries a WHIP. A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many N strands. The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the N extremity of each. Burch says again: C BURCH (CONT\\'D) D Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia. N Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism. He will say D nothing of the kind. N As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men. He is N pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his N back. Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon N down in a bent position. N With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the N back with the paddle. Burch strikes him wordlessly - no N taunting, no sneering. Solomon screaming against each N blow. His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND C BRUISES. D This beating continues on and on and on until quite N literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort. N Dripping in sweat and panting: O (CONTINUED) O 18. O 25 CONTINUED: (2) 25 C BURCH (CONT\\'D) D Yah still insist yah a free man? C SOLOMON D ...I...I insist... D Burch regrets hearing this. Not from sympathy, but N rather because he\\'s nearly too tired to go back to N beating Solomon. Yet, as if returning to work, Burch N returns to pummeling Solomon. Burch punctuates the blows O WITH: C BURCH D Yah a slave. Yah a Georgia slave! N Burch continues to strike, and strike... This time until N the paddle SNAPS IN HALF. Burch then GRABS THE WHIP. N Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly, N the flails cutting into Solomon\\'s back. Again, Burch\\'s N arm tires before Solomon \"breaks.\" C BURCH (CONT\\'D) D Are yah slave? C SOLOMON D ...No... N Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping... N SOLOMON\\'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND N OOZING WITH BLOOD. Finally Burch can whip no more. He N pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough N energy to take up his instruments and EXIT. Radburn N lingers for a moment. He takes the irons off Solomon\\'s N legs. Opens the window some. As he makes these N gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one N wrought with poor sincerity:: C RADBURN D I seen a good many of the black D kind just where yah\\'re. Sick. D Make me sick. Often times the D situation was resolved, and I D think; what was all the beatin\\' D and abuse for? Things end as they D should, and the violence was for D naught. So why cause trouble when D they ain\\'t no cause for it? Be of D a cooperative nature, and things D don\\'t need be particularly D unpleasant. E (BEAT) D Or, yah can carry on like yah D been, and I fear yah won\\'t live to D see Sunday next. N With that thought, Radburn exits. Solomon rests. But to N rest seems like giving in to defeat. He begins pulling O (CONTINUED) O 19. O 25 CONTINUED: (3) 25 N on his chains. But for all his struggling, the chain N loosens none. Solomon calls out: C SOLOMON D Help me! Someone help me! N If anyone at all hears him, they do not respond. Solomon N continues his plaintive cry for assistance. O 26 26 S EXT. BURCH\\'S DUNGEON - CONTINUOUS N Beginning with a TIGHT SHOT on the shuttered, barred N window of Burch\\'s dungeon - Solomon\\'s cries barely eking N beyond the space - THE CAMERA PULLS BACK from the N building, onto the city until clearly visible is the N Nation\\'s capital. It\\'s icon\\'s of freedom - the WHITE N HOUSE, the CAPITOL BUILDING - fairly mocking Solomon\\'s N captivity. Simultaneously, barren at the early hour and N cluttered with litter and the remains of previous day\\'s N procession, the city is a bleak and forboding sight. O 27 27 S INT. BURCH\\'S DUNGEON - DAY N IT IS DAY NOW. The door to the yard is thrown open. The N harsh white light floods all over Solomon. O 28 OMITTED 28 O (CONTINUED) O 20. O 28 CONTINUED: 28 M 29 MOVED TO SC. A32 29 O 21. S 30 EXT. BURCH\\'S DUNGEON/YARD - DAY 30 N It is a yard just beyond Burch\\'s. The yard is hemmed in N by a brick wall. In the yard are two men, and a boy. N The oldest is CLEMENS RAY a man of about 25 years of age. N He is well educated. JOHN WILLIAMS is about 20 years N old. He is born and bred a slave, is lacking in N education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation. N Finally there is a child about 10 years of age who N answers to the name of Randall. N Solomon, Clemens Ray, John and Randall ALL STAND NAKED. N Though they try to cover their privates a bit, they are N all aware of the uselessness of modesty. Radburn is N present. He has before him A COUPLE OF BUCKETS OF COLD N WATER. He throws water on the naked men. C RADBURN D Go on. Warsh up. N The men, soaking in humility as well as water, begin to N scrub with A SINGLE BAR OF HARSH SOAP passed among them. C RADBURN (CONT\\'D) D The boy, too. Get him clean. N Solomon takes some soap and rubs it over Randall. C RADBURN (CONT\\'D) D Scrub now. Git \\'em clean. N Solomon scrubs harder. Randall - clearly cold and N uncomfortable - appeals to Solomon. C RANDALL D Do you know when my Mama will D come? C RADBURN D Hush him up! N Seeing Solomon has no answer for him, Randall begins to N cry. C RANDALL D Mama ..! Mama! Is she going to D come? N Doing all he can to spare the child from a certain N BEATING: C SOLOMON D Quiet, please. N Randall is becoming nearly inconsolable. C RANDALL D Mama! O (CONTINUED) C 21A. O 30 CONTINUED: 30 N Saying anything to keep the boy quiet: C SOLOMON D Your mother will come, I swear she D will, but you must be silent. D Please. Be silent! N On the seeming strength of Solomon\\'s promise, Randall N goes silent. Solomon looks to Radburn, who just throws N water on the soapy men. O 22. O 31 OMITTED 31 S A32 INT. BURCH\\'S DUNGEON - EVENING A32 N Radburn brings food in to Solomon; a shriveled piece of N meat and some water. Just barely enough to sustain N Solomon. Radburn also has a SHIRT. C RADBURN D That old thing of yours is just D rags and tatters. Need something D proper to wear. D Solomon doesn\\'t move for the clothing. C RADBURN (CONT\\'D) D Go\\'won. Put it on. D With slow defiance, Solomon does as instructed. He N removes what remains of his old shirt - the one he was D wearing when first kidnapped - and puts on the one N Radburn brought him. The shirt\\'s ill-fitting and dirty. N Despite that, Radburn says: C RADBURN (CONT\\'D) D There. Tha\\'s fine. Tha\\'s fine. D Got no gratitude? C SOLOMON D ...Thank you... C RADBURN D Yah keep bein\\' proper, yah\\'ll see D how things work out. N Radburn starts to take the old shirt. C SOLOMON D No! It was from my wife. C RADBURN D Rags and tatters. Rags and D tatters. D Taking the shirt, the \"rags and tatters\" as he calls N them, Radburn exits, locking the door behind him. N Solomon sits with the plate of food before him. He N pushes the plate away rather than eat. O 32 32 S EXT. BURCH\\'S DUNGEON/YARD - DAY N Sitting together out in the yard are Clemens Ray, John N and Solomon. Over time they have drawn trustworthy D enough to speak with one another. At the moment Solomon N is still trying to apply reason to the situation. O (CONTINUED) M 22A. O 32 CONTINUED: 32 N Randall wanders about in the background. As usual, he N calls out for his \"Mama.\" By now, however, his calls N should feel like little more than background noise. C SOLOMON D This can\\'t stand. It is a crime. D I believe now someone lay in wait D for me. My drink was altered... D We are free men. They have...they D have no right to hold us. N Solomon waits for a response from the others. They give O none. C SOLOMON (CONT\\'D) D We need a sympathetic ear. If we D have an opportunity to explain our D SITUATION-- C CLEMENS D Who in your estimation is that D sympathetic ear? C SOLOMON D The two men I journeyed with. I\\'m D certain they\\'re making inquires at D this very moment. C CLEMENS D I would be just as certain they D are counting the money paid for D delivering you to this place. C SOLOMON D They were not kidnappers. They D were artists. Fellow performers. C CLEMENS D You know that? You know for D certain who they were? O (CONTINUED) O 23. O 32 CONTINUED: (2) 32 D The fact is, Solomon can\\'t say for certain. C CLEMENS (CONT\\'D) D How I reckon the situation: D whatever past we had...well, D that\\'s done now. The reality to D come is us being transported D southward. New Orleans if I were D to venture. After we arrive, D we\\'ll be put to market. Beyond D that... Well, once in a slave D state I suppose there\\'s only one D outcome. C JOHN D No. C CLEMENS D I don\\'t say that to give you empty D agitation, John... C JOHN D For y\\'all. For y\\'all they ain\\'t D nothin\\' but that! But John was\\'n D kidnapped. John bein\\' hold as D debt, tha\\'s all. Massa pay his D debt, and John be redeemed-- C CLEMENS D Boy, our masters will not come for D us. N John is nearly beside himself with panic. C JOHN D Now John\\'s...John\\'s sorry for D y\\'all, but tha\\'s how it be. Where D y\\'all goin\\', yah goin\\' witout D John. Massa take care of me. D Massa take care. C RANDALL D Mama! N All three men turn and look. At the moment Randall N doesn\\'t call out emptily. At the door to the yard is N Burch along with two women. One in her late twenties; N ELIZA. She is \"arrayed in silk, with rings upon her N fingers, and golden ornaments suspended from her ears.\" N Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has - to this N point - lived well. This is reflected in her airs and N her speech. The other is a little girl, light in skin N color, of about seven or eight. This is EMILY, Randall\\'s N half sister. N As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight, N then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy. Clearly N this is mother and child being reunited. O (CONTINUED) O 24. O 32 CONTINUED: (3) 32 N As Burch locks the yard door, Eliza clutches Randall. N She is overcome with emotion. C ELIZA D My darling. My sweet, sweet baby. O 33 33 S INT. BURCH\\'S DUNGEON - EVENING N Later in the evening. Solomon now shares his space with N Eliza and her children. As the children rest, Eliza N drops into a lament as if pleading her case to Solomon N who lends a sympathetic ear. N Both slyly, and with a bit of aggrandizement: C ELIZA D When I say I had my master\\'s D favor, you understand. Above even D his own wife, I had it. Do you D know that he built a house for me? D Built it on the sole condition D that I reside there with him. The D added promise in time I would be D emancipated. And for nine years D he blessed me with every comfort D and luxury in life. D Displaying the finery she still wears: C ELIZA (CONT\\'D) D Silks and jewels and even servants D to wait upon us. Such was our D life, and the life of this D beautiful girl I bore for him. D But Master Berry\\'s daughter...she D always looked at me with an unkind D nature. She hated Emily no matter D she and Emily were flesh of flesh. D As Master Berry\\'s health failed, D she gained power in the household. D Eventually, I was brought to the D city on the false pretense of our D free papers being executed. If I D had known what waited; to be sent D south? I swear I would not have D come here alive. O (CONTINUED) O 25.

A KEY TURNS IN N THE LOCK AND THE DOOR OPENS. Burch enters with Radburn N beside him. Both carry LANTERNS with them. Hardly N giving Solomon and Eliza a moment to rouse themselves, N BURCH DEMANDS: C BURCH D Come on. Get yer blankets. Get D up. N Sensing that things will not end well: C ELIZA D No, please don\\'t... C BURCH D I don\\'t want to hear yer talk. D Get in the yard. C ELIZA O Please... C RADBURN D Ain\\'t no need for all that.

BURCH\\'S DUNGEON/YARD - NIGHT N We now have Solomon, Clemens, John, Eliza and the N children. They are being cuffed together. As John is N cuffed, he pulls back. Scared. He beings in N DESPERATION: C JOHN D John\\'s massa gunna pay his debt. D John\\'s massa gunna come for him. O (CONTINUED) O 26-28. O 35 CONTINUED: 35 N Not wanting to hear any of this talk, Burch strikes John N several times in the head with a sap-like instrument. N Weakened, but again: C JOHN (CONT\\'D) D John\\'s massa gunna-- N Burch again strikes John until he\\'s quiet. Curiously, N Emily and Randall don\\'t even flinch. Why would they? N They are quite used to seeing this kind of violence. C BURCH D Not a word out of none a yah. Not D a word. N Burch and Radburn begin driving the shackled slaves from S the yard. M A36 A36 S EXT. BURCH\\'S DUNGEON/INT. WAGON/FLAT BED - LATER N The slaves are lead to a flat bed of the horse and N carriage. They are made to lay down side-by-side. We stay N with them as some sort of cloth is flung over them, N obscuring and blacking out their view. N At that moment, the screen is BLACKENED and we hear the N sound of the cart moving in haste. O 36 36 S EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. DOCK - NIGHT N Led by Burch, the group of slaves arrive to a dock. They N are taken quickly up a gangplank and onto the steamboat N ORLEANS as the CAPTAIN, CREW and a MULATTO WOMAN WATCH, N but do not interfere. O 37 37 S INT. ORLEANS/HOLD - CONTINUOUS N The slaves are hustled down one at a time into a dark, N dank hold among barrels and boxes of freight...and RATS. N Burch comes around and \"checks\" the chains; makes sure N they are all secure and locked. N Satisfied, he heads up out of the hold. Radburn follows. N Alone in the dark in the hold, John cries, as does Eliza. N Solomon stares down Burch for as long as he can, as if N wishing bad things. As if wanting to exact some measure N of revenge. But the greater insult is that Burch and N Radburn, engaged in conversation, take no notice of N Solomon whatsoever. He is that insignificant to them. N That fact, that reality, makes Solomon boil with a rage N he cannot express in words. O 38 38 C OMIT O 26-28A. S 38A INT.

N Sardines are laid out to dry in rows, glittering in the N day\\'s sun as if like silver pennies. A chain of slaves N enter the frame and are led one by one on to the docked C vessel. N MORE SLAVES - about 15 in all, of various genders and N ages - are brought on board. Chief among them is ROBERT N who fights viciously with his captors. \"With all haste\" N is shoved down into the hold. N Having taken their cargo as far as they care or need to, N Burch and Radburn depart. They do so without a word D spoken to Solomon or the others.

C CLEMENS RAY D Survival is not about certain D death, it is about keeping your D head down. N Solomon looks at Clemens Ray, agitated -- his voice now N raised above the previous whispers.

Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the N hold. N As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand N between Eliza and the Sailor. Stretching out a firm hand N to the sailor\\'s shoulder, Robert\\'s look says \"No you N don\\'t.\" N Clemens Ray is awake now, watching. N There is an odd moment of stillness between the Sailor N and Robert, an impasse. N We focus on the Sailor\\'s face. Slowly, a greasy smile N erupts upon it. Back now to Robert\\'s face, a look of N incomprehension. N Robert looks down. We follow his gaze to the knife that N has already been jabbed unseen between Robert\\'s ribs. N The sailor withdraws the bloody blade. N A wide shot of the two men. Robert collapses to the N floor like a sack of potatoes. N Clemens Ray and Solomon react. Complete horror. O 49 OMIT 49 O 50 OMIT 50 O 33. S 51 EXT. ORLEANS/DECK - DAY 51 N We are back up on the deck of the ship. SOLOMON AND N CLEMENS RAY dump ROBERT\\'s body over the side of the ship. N Solomon watches as the body churns for a moment in the N wake of the vessel... then sinks beneath the water. N Clemens Ray, with no sentimentality: C CLEMENS RAY D Better off. Better than us. S 51A EXT. NEW ORLEANS HARBOUR - DAY 51A N Solomon\\'s POV from the back of the steamship of Robert\\'s N corpse slipping gracefully into the water. S 52 EXT. NEW ORLEANS/PORT - DAY 52 S -MID MAY, 1841- N A white male, fairly smart, with broad shoulders, stands N AND BELLOWS- C RAY D Clemens...! Clemens Ray! D We are in the port of New Orleans, one of the busiest in D the young nation. N On the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods N are loaded and unloaded from a various ships. It\\'s a bit N of controlled chaos as a VARIETY OF LANGUAGES are spoken N and shouted while slaves are shuttled from the Orleans to N a holding pen. Solomon, and all the slaves are N overwhelmed by all that is happening around them. N Two men - among many - are awaiting the arrival of the N Orleans. They are JONUS RAY - Clemens Ray\\'s master - and N DAVIS who is the solicitor of Mr. Ray. They both look N like they mean business. The moment the gangplank is N laid, Ray yells for Clemens. N Clemens, seeing his master, is nearly crazy with delight. N He is, uncharacteristically beside himself. Ironically, N his master now represents \"freedom.\" O (CONTINUED) O 34. O 52 CONTINUED: 52 C CLEMENS D ...My master... Master Ray, sir! D Master Ray! N Clemens pulls on his chain. As he does so, Several other N slaves collapse in his effort to reach his master, like N dominos. C RAY D Who is in charge of this vessel? C CAPTAIN D I am the Captain. C RAY D I am Mr. Jonus Ray. My solicitor D has documentation verifying that D the Negro named Clemens Ray is my D property. N As he reads PAPERS handed to him by Davis: C CAPTAIN D I know nothing of-- C RAY D You are ordered by court to return D that property immediately, or face D charges of thievery. C CAPTAIN D My duty is to transport goods. I D am not responsible for their D origin. C RAY D Remove these contraptions! D To his mate: C CAPTAIN D Free him! N Biddee does as ordered. Once free, Clemens hugs and sobs N over his master as would a lost and then found child. C RAY D It\\'s all well, now, Clemens. You D will return home with me. E (to the Captain) D Consider this notice and warning. O (CONTINUED) O 35. O 52 CONTINUED: (2) 52 N Ray, Davis and Clemens head away. Solomon seems both N desperate and hopeful of some aid from Clemens and Ray. N But there is none forthcoming. Ray and Clemens continue D on - Clemens not so much as even looking back in N Solomon\\'s direction. Solomon stands and watches as they N fade into the environs and are gone from sight. O 53 53 S EXT. NEW ORLEANS/PORT - LATER N Hours later. The slaves sit off on one side of the dock, N baking in the sun, awaiting their fate. N THEOPHILUS FREEMAN - a tall, thin-faced man with light N complexion and a little bent - moves along the deck N calling out names from a list. The slaves STAND as they N are called. C FREEMAN D Oren. John. Lethe. Eliza. D Randall. Emily. Platt... Platt! N Solomon does not respond. Freeman looks around. He D spots Solomon. C FREEMAN (CONT\\'D) D Captain, who shipped that nigger? D CAPTAIN D Burch. N Freeman steps to Solomon. He gives him a looking over. C FREEMAN D Stand up. D Solomon does as told. C FREEMAN (CONT\\'D) D You fit the description given. D Why didn\\'t you answer when called? C SOLOMON D My name is not Platt. My name is-- N Freeman strikes Solomon hard across the face. C FREEMAN D Your name is Platt, and I will D teach you your name so that you D don\\'t forget. E (to the Captain) D Shackle my niggers. Get them to D my cart. O 36. S 54 I/E. CART - LATER 54 N Solomon is carted off along with the rest of \"Burch\\'s N stock:\" Eliza and her children, John and Solomon. N As they move off from the port in a make-shift cart, it N opens up to the frenzic, busy port. N For the first time Solomon sees true and severe slavery. N These are not visiting servants, such as Jasper was back N in Saratoga. These are humans held in strict bondage - N herded like cattle, chained together as if in a \"chain N gang.\" Slaves are evident not merely by the color of N their skin. The residue and accessories of slavery are N everywhere. Blacks almost universally display scars - N THICK AND HEAVY DEAD TISSUE FROM LACERATIONS LEFT N UNTREATED - brands, and are often missing limbs. Blacks N are held in all types of shackles, from simple chains to N elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked. D Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits. One slave is N attacked by a dog and the slave owner. The dog pulls and N tears at the slave\\'s clothes. THESE IMAGES SHOULD BE A N CONSTANT AND CONTINUAL CANVAS TO THE PIECE. EVER N PRESENT, BUT NOT REALLY COMMENTED ON AS THEY ARE THE N NORM. They should be a reminder that not only are people N being oppressed, but that there is an entire system of N oppression in place. O 55 55 S EXT. FREEMAN\\'S SLAVE PEN - LATER N \"Burch\\'s stock:\" arrive at Freeman\\'s slave pen. They are N led in by Freeman and his house slave CAPE - a mulatto. N The yard is enclosed by plank, standing upright, with N ends sharpened instead of brick walls as with Burch\\'s. N Including Burch\\'s group there are about 30 SLAVES in the C pen. N Solomon and the others look around and see nothing but N downtrodden and despondent faces. Three men sit next to N each other with muzzles and quietly stare back at this N new batch of arrivals. One attempts to speak, but all N that comes out is a muffled, unintelligible sound. O 56 56 S EXT. FREEMAN\\'S SLAVE PEN - LATER N The slaves are in various states of undress, men and N women alike. They clean themselves, scrubbing with soap N and water. Women wash their hair. Men shave, skin is N oiled. Freeman walks among them, inspecting them as they N primp themselves. O 57 57 S INT. FREEMAN\\'S SLAVE PEN - LATER N The slaves are given new clothes by Cape. The men are N given hat, coat, shirt, pants and shoes. The women O (CONTINUED) O 37. O 57 CONTINUED: 57 N frocks of calico and handkerchiefs to bind about their N heads. S 58 INT. FREEMAN\\'S/GREAT ROOM - LATER 58 N It\\'s an odd, ironic scene. The slaves are in a large and N fairly ornate room within Freeman\\'s house. CAPE PLAYS A N PAINFUL TUNE ON A FIDDLE - background music - as Freeman N tries to line up A SMALL GROUP OF THE SLAVES, he becomes N less patient, jittery and nervous, knowing that his N livelihood is at stake, he wants his slaves to make a N good impression. Sometimes his patience gets the better N of him, and his hands move freely in direction of the D slaves. N The business has the air of an etiquette class, though N what Freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into N being more \"sellable.\" He works with them in groups of N five or so. C FREEMAN D Tallest to smallest, understand? D Are you taller than her? Then D you\\'d go before her. Do it. D Move. E (to the group) D Keep your heads up. A sense of D direction; that\\'s how you look D smart. None of those saucer eyes. D Rid yourself of that smile. Look N like a goddamn grinnin\\' monkey. D Put the least thought in your D head. C\\'mon, now. Think of D somethin\\'. N Weary of Cape\\'s playing, Solomon moves to Cape. He asks: C SOLOMON D Can you play a reel? C CAPE E (DISMISSIVE) D Nah. I don\\'t know no reel. C SOLOMON D If I may...? N Cape looks to Freeman: C FREEMAN D He sick of your caterwaulin\\'. Let D him play, boy. Let\\'s see what he D can do. N Cape reluctantly hands the fiddle over to Solomon. N Solomon tunes it a bit, then begins to play. His fingers N stiff at first, he takes a moment to warm up. But as he N warms up he is, despite the circumstances, masterful. O (CONTINUED) O 38. O 58 CONTINUED: 58 N THE SLAVES ALL CLAP ALONG. SOME DANCE ALONG. All admire N his work. Freeman chief among them. C FREEMAN (CONT\\'D) D Keep on. Keep on. D Solomon continues to play. C FREEMAN (CONT\\'D) D A damn sight better than you, D Cape. A damn sight better. N Cape looks bitter as Solomon plays on. O 59 59 S INT. FREEMAN\\'S/GREAT ROOM - DAY N We come in on an odd sort of sight; A JUMBLE OF ACTIVITY. N CUSTOMERS have come to see Freeman\\'s lot - the room all N gussied up with flowers. Freeman moves among them, N displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel. N Freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up - \"look N smart\" as he previously admonished them. They are made N to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their N hands and arms and bodies, turn them about and ask what N skills they possess. The Customers routinely make the N slaves open their mouths and show their teeth. N At times a MALE or FEMALE SLAVE are taken off to the N side, stripped and inspected more minutely. N One of them, John, is stripped and inspected. N Cape, as he\\'s done previously, plays his fiddle. N A buyer - WILLIAM FORD; a man of middle age, and an N attractive nature in his tone of voice - consults a list N he\\'s drawn up and asks of Freeman: C FORD D What is the price for the ones D Platt and Eliza? C FREEMAN D A thousand for Platt; he is a D nigger of talent. Seven hundred D for Eliza. My fairest price. C FORD D You will accept a note? C FREEMAN D As always, from you, Mr. Ford. N Eliza is beside herself as it seems she is about to be N separated from her family. She begs of Ford: O (CONTINUED) O 39. O 59 CONTINUED: 59 C ELIZA D Please, sir... Please don\\'t D divide my family. Don\\'t take me D unless you take my children as D well. C FREEMAN D Eliza, quiet! C ELIZA D You will have the most faithful D slave in me, sir. The most D faithful slave that has ever D lived, but I beg that you do not D separate us. N A BUYER interrupts the skirmish and approaches Freeman N and delivers coolly, eyeing Randall- C BUYER D Your price for the child? C FREEMAN D You see how fit the boy is. Like D ripe fruit. He will grow into a D fine beast. N Randall is made to run, and jump by FREEMAN - exhibiting N his activity and his condition. C FREEMAN (CONT\\'D) D Six hundred, and that\\'s fair and D final. C BUYER D Done. N He reaches into his waistcoat and retrieves his wallet, N counting out six hundred dollars, placing them into the N already extended hand of Freeman. N Ford sees the distress and panic in Eliza; it visibly N touches him. He now tries to buy EMILY to console her. C FORD D How much for the little girl? You D have no need for her. One so D young will bring you no profit. C FREEMAN D I will not sell the girl. There\\'s D heaps \\'n piles of money to be made D off her. She is a beauty. One of D the regular bloods. None of your D thick-lipped, bullet headed, D cotton picking niggers. O (CONTINUED) O 39A. O 59 CONTINUED: (2) 59 C FORD D Her child, man. For God\\'s sake, D are you not sentimental in the D least? C FREEMAN D My sentimentality stretches the D length of a coin. Do you want the D lot, Mr. Ford, or do you pass on D them all? C FORD D I will take the ones Platt and D Eliza. N Eliza grips her children tight. C ELIZA D I will not go without my children. D You will not take them from me. O (CONTINUED) O 40. O 59 CONTINUED: (3) 59 N As if to prove her wrong, Freeman puts a foot to Eliza N and harshly kicks her away from Emily. C ELIZA (CONT\\'D) D Please, don\\'t. No! D Freeman, to Cape: C FREEMAN D Take her out of here. N Cape DROPS HIS FIDDLE, begins to pull Eliza away toward N the door of the room, but her screaming and pleading do N not abate. IT IS CLEARLY UNSETTLING TO THE OTHER BUYERS. C FREEMAN (CONT\\'D) D Keep her quiet. N Cape tries to muzzle her with his hand, but Eliza N continues to scream for her children as Emily does for N her mother. C EMILY D Mama... Mama! C FREEMAN E (TO SOLOMON) D Play something! Get the fiddle D and play. N As ordered, Solomon takes up Cape\\'s fiddle and begins to N play lightly. C FREEMAN (CONT\\'D) D Play! D Solomon plays harder and more loudly. Still, it is N barely enough to drown out Eliza\\'s cries. Freeman gets N the other slaves to clap along with Solomon\\'s playing. N Emily frees herself and runs back, crying but endeavoring N to be strong- C EMILY D Don\\'t cry, Mama. I will be a good D girl. Don\\'t cry. I will keep my D head up and I will look smart. I N will always look smart. C FREEMAN D Make merry, all of you! Goddamn D it, Cape! Keep her quiet or it\\'s D your damned hide I will take it D out of! N Cape pulls a rag, stuffs it in Eliza\\'s mouth. Clamping N both hands over her mouth, he hauls Eliza from the room N by the head. IT IS AN UGLY, UGLY SCENE. O 40A. S 60 EXT. FORD PLANTATION - LATER 60 N Driven in a horse drawn wagon by Ford are Solomon and N Eliza. Eliza is sullen to say the least. With the loss N of her two children she has dropped into a depression she N will not be able to pull out of. O (CONTINUED) O 41. O 60 CONTINUED: 60 S They arrive to the FORD PLANTATION. The main house of N the plantation - the GREAT HOUSE as they are commonly N called - is sizable. Two stories high with a piazza in N front. In the rear are also a log kitchen, poultry N house, corncribs and several slave cabins. The N plantation is described as \"a green spot in the N wilderness.\" N With the arrival of Master Ford there is a flurry of N activity - the \"excitement\" of a new delivery. MR. N CHAPIN, a white overseer, instructs a slave named SAM. C CHAPIN D Sam, call to the Mistress. C SAM D Mistress! Mistress, they arrivn\\'. N MISTRESS FORD EXITS the house - along with her attending N slave, RACHEL, who is a cook AS WELL AS SAM\\'S WIFE - and N travels to her husband, kisses him, then laughingly N INQUIRES: C MRS. FORD D Did you bring all those niggers? D Two of them? You got two? C FORD D Make me something to eat, dear. D The day has taken it from me. C MRS. FORD D Let me get a look at them... C FORD C Mr. Chapin-- D MRS. FORD E (RE: ELIZA) D This one\\'s cryin\\'. Why is this D one cryin\\'? C FORD D Separated from her children. C MRS. FORD D Oh, dear. C FORD D It couldn\\'t be helped.

N Tibeats nods in Chapin\\'s direction: C TIBEATS (CONT\\'D) D Mister Chapin is the overseer on D this plantation. He is D responsible for all of Ford\\'s D property. You too will refer to D him as Master. D This plantation covers many D hundreds of acres, and you will D traverse the Texas road between D the forest site and the sawmill in D double time. Any clever nigger on D that path that gets a little D lightfooted, I will remind him D that on one side men and D bloodhounds patrol the border and D on the other the bayou provides a D hard living, with alligators and D little to eat or drink that won\\'t D kill you. No slave has escaped D here with his life. You\\'re here D to work niggers, so let\\'s O commence. N Tibeats begins to sing the song \"Run Nigger, Run\" N mockingly.

WOODS - DAY 61 S -END OF MAY THROUGH EARLY JUNE, 1841- N We are in a wooded area. There is A GANG OF SLAVES N chopping trees into timber. It is hard, laborious work N made no more easy by the sweltering heat. Solomon is N among them as well as Sam. O 62 62 S EXT. WOODS - LATER N The slaves now load the timber onto a horse drawn wagon. N Again, hard work done under the ever present sun. O 42B. S 63 EXT. ROAD - LATER 63 N As Sam drives the wagon, the other slaves trudge along N side by foot. We should get the sense the travel is long N and tedious. S 64 EXT. FORD\\'S WORK AREA - LATER 64 N It is a sizable work area on the edge of Indian Creek. N There is much work being done, the slaves primarily N employed in piling the timber and chopping it into D lumber. As before, there is little doubt about the D rigors of the job at hand. N Working as a carpenter at the work area is JOHN TIBEATS. N There are also various CUSTOMERS who move about placing N orders. O 65 65 S EXT. FORD PLANTATION - DAY S -EARLY TO MID JUNE, 1841- N It\\'s Sunday morning. All of Ford\\'s slaves are dressed N with their \"finest\" clothes - brightly colored and as N free as possible of defect. The slaves are gathered on O (CONTINUED) O 43. O 65 CONTINUED: 65 S the lawn just beyond the piazza. Mistress Ford is N present as well. As the slaves listen, Ford reads to N them Scripture. His tone is of a man trying to preach by N way of compassion. C FORD D \"But as touching the resurrection D of the dead, have ye not read that D which was spoken unto you by God, D saying, I am the God of Abraham, D and the God of Isaac, and the God D of Jacob. God is not the God of D the dead, but of the living. And D when the multitude heard this, D they were astonished at his D doctrine. Then one of them, which D was a lawyer, asked him a D question, tempting him, and D saying, Master, which is the D great commandment in the law? D Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt D love the Lord thy God with all thy D heart, and with all thy soul, and D with all thy mind. This is the D first and great commandment. And D the second is like unto it, thou D shalt love thy neighbor as D thyself. On these two D commandments hang all the law and D the prophets.\" D Despite the lightness with which Ford speaks and the hope N in his words, ELIZA SITS OFF TO THE SIDE - SELF-SECLUDED N A BIT - WEEPING GENTLY. N We should be able to see in Mistress Ford\\'s eyes that N Eliza\\'s constant crying is unsettling. O 66 66 T OMITTED O 67 OMIT 67 O 68 OMITTED 68 O 44. O 69 OMIT 69 S 70 EXT. FORD\\'S WORK AREA - DAY 70 S -MID JUNE, 1841- N The slaves have broken for lunch. They snack on smoked N meat and drink water from gourds. As they lunch Solomon N reads from Sam\\'s Bible to the other slaves. C SOLOMON D But he that is greatest among you, D let him be as the younger; and he D that is chief, as he that doth D serve. For whether is greater, he D that sitteth at meat, or he that D serveth? Is not he that sitteth D at meat? But I am among you as he D that serveth. D A white customer - WINSLOW - irate at the sight and sound N of slaves reading Scripture, crosses over. He grabs the N Bible. C WINSLOW D From where did you thieve this? C SAM D Suh, the book is my property. N The White Customer has no interest in Sam\\'s answer. With N flailing hands he STARTS BEATING ON SAM. Solomon tries N to stop him. That only makes the situation worse, N Solomon now the target of the man\\'s ire. C WINSLOW D Take your hands from me! N Ford comes running over. C FORD D What is the commotion? C WINSLOW D Your niggers are either brazen or D rebellious. This one was readin\\' D Scripture, and this one claims it D to be his. C FORD D It is. A gift from his Mistress. C WINSLOW D You condone this? C FORD D I encourage it. As a Christian I D can do no less. O (CONTINUED) O 45. O 70 CONTINUED: 70 C WINSLOW D You can do no worse, Ford. A D slave that reads is dangerous. N Winslow moves off. He yells back at Ford: C WINSLOW (CONT\\'D) D And the man who would allow a D slave to read is unfit to own D niggers! D Handing the Bible back to Sam, very matter of factly: C FORD D Pay him no mind. The word of God D applies to all. In that you may D take comfort. O 71 71 T OMITTED S 72 EXT. ROAD - DAY 72 N Sam is at the reigns of the wagon carrying the timber to N Ford\\'s WORK AREA. Slaves trudge alongside, same as it N ever was. Only...it\\'s not quite the same. Sam brings N the wagon to a halt. He, and the slaves look up the road N ahead of them. N Standing in the middle of the road is a group of N CHICKASAWS INDIANS. They are in their \"usual\" dress of N buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic N colors, buttoned from belt to chin. They have with them N DOGS and HORSES. They carry with them the carcass of a N deer. N The two groups stare at each other for a long moment. O 73 73 S EXT. FIELD - DUSK/END OF DAY N The groups of slaves and Chickasaws are now intermingled. N They \"break bread\" - actually they work on the carcass of N the deer which is now roasting over a large fire. As N well the group share a smoke on a pipe. N One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an \"INDIAN N FIDDLE.\" The Chickasaws perform a customary dance; N trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a N guttural, sing-song noise. D The slaves enjoy the respite from work, Solomon D particularly taken by the music...if not entirely N enthralled by it. O (CONTINUED) O 46. O 73 CONTINUED: 73 N After a bit, Solomon rights himself and heads from the N group. S 74 EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS 74 N Solomon arrives to some tall grass at the edge of the N river. Lowering his trousers, SOLOMON SQUATS TO N DEFECATE. As he does, he stares out toward the flowing N waters of Indian Creek. After a few moments, as though a N thought far greater than relieving himself has come to N him, Solomon stands and replaces his pants. N Oddly, Solomon stares out at the water as though he were N a man possessed. O 75 75 S EXT. FORD\\'S WORK AREA - DAY N Just beyond the WORK AREA Solomon speaks with Ford as N Tibeats listens. Solomon is drawing in the dirt, making N rough diagrams for Ford as he explains himself. C SOLOMON D The creek is plenty deep enough to D sail, even with a boat full of D load. The distance from the WORK D AREA to the point on the latter D bayou is several miles by water D fewer than land. It occurs to me D that the expense of the D transportation would be materially C DIMINISHED-- C TIBEATS D \"Materially diminished?\" C SOLOMON D If we use the waterway. C TIBEATS D It\\'s a scheme. Plenty of D engineers have schemed similarly. N The passes are too tight. C SOLOMON D I reckon them at more than twelve D feet at their most narrow. Wide D enough for a tub to traverse. A D team of niggers can clear it out. C TIBEATS D And you know what of transport and D terra formin\\'? O (CONTINUED) O 47. O 75 CONTINUED: 75 C SOLOMON D I labored repairing the Champlain D canal, on the section over which D William Van Nortwick was D superintendent. With my earnings D I hired several efficient hands to D assist me, and I entered into D contracts for the transportation D of large rafts of timber from Lake D Champlain to Troy. C FORD E (TO TIBEATS) D I\\'ll admit to being impressed even D if you won\\'t. E (TO SOLOMON) D Collect a gang, see what good you D can do. O 76 76 S EXT. CREEK - DAY O -END OF JUNE, 1841- N WE HAVE A SERIES OF SCENES in which we see Solomon and a N TEAM OF BLACKS working on the creek: CHOPPING TREES N ALONG THE BANKS, widening out the shore... It\\'s all just N a trial for now. The work is diligent, but it is basic D to this point. Still, under Solomon\\'s direction, the N slaves go at it like they\\'ve got something to prove. And D rightly they do. N Solomon also works on a narrow raft of twelve cribs with N which he will transport the timber. N Once this is constructed, HE PERSONALLY \"SAILS\" THEM UP N THE CREEK WITH A TEST LOAD. O 77 77 S EXT. FORD\\'S WORK AREA - LATER N Ford and a group of slaves wait along the river banks N just beyond the WORK AREA. All are expectant in their N manner. A long moment passes with no sign of Solomon. N Then, from up river, we see Solomon\\'s raft of lumber N winding its way. SLAVES CHEER, and Ford literally N applauds the effort. Tibeats looks pissed. He has just N been shown up after all. O 78 78 S EXT. FORD PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - DAY N As we come into the scene, Ford is presenting Solomon N with a fiddle. Not as grand as the one he previously N owned in New York, but a fine instrument none the less. N It is a gift of thanks for his hard work. Solomon\\'s N gratitude is easily expressed. O (CONTINUED) O 48. O 78 CONTINUED: 78 C SOLOMON D My great thanks, Master Ford. C FORD D My thanks to you, and it is the D least of it. My hope is that it D brings us both much joy over the O years. N Following the statement, Solomon\\'s not sure how to react. N He remains grateful, but the thought of \"over the years\" N is just a reminder of the altered state in which he now N finds himself. O 79 79 S EXT. FORD PLANATION/SLAVE SHACK - EVENING S -END OF JULY, 1841- N The slaves eat. All tired from a days work they conduct N themselves in silence. All except for Eliza who, N SLIPPING INTO PERMANENT DEPRESSION, as always weeps. The N sound of her sobbing edging him up - particularly after N Master Ford\\'s \"over the years\" observation. Solomon N FINALLY SNAPS: C SOLOMON D Eliza. Eliza, stop! N Solomon goes to her, grabs Eliza. She does not stop. As N if to force the misery from her, Solomon SHAKES ELIZA N VIOLENTLY. C SOLOMON (CONT\\'D) D Stop it! Stop! C ELIZA D It\\'s all I have to keeps my loss D present. C SOLOMON D You let yourself be overcome by D sorrow. You will drown in it. C ELIZA D Have you stopped crying for your D children? You make no sounds, but D will you ever let them go in your D heart? C SOLOMON D ...They are as my flesh... O (CONTINUED) O 49. O 79 CONTINUED: 79 C ELIZA D Then who is distressed? Do I D upset the Mistress and the Master? D Do you care less for my loss than D their well being? C SOLOMON D Master Ford is a decent man. C ELIZA D He is a slaver. C SOLOMON D Under the circumstances-- C ELIZA D Under the circumstances he is a D slaver! Christian only in his D proclamations. Separated me from D my precious babies for lack of a D few dollars. But you truckle at N HIS BOOT-- C SOLOMON D No... C ELIZA D You luxuriate in his favor. C SOLOMON D I survive. I will not fall into D despair. Woeful and crushed; D melancholy is the yolk I see most. D I will offer up my talents to D Master Ford. I will keep myself D hearty until freedom is opportune. C ELIZA D Ford is your opportunity. Do you D think he does not know that you D are more than you suggest? But he D does nothing for you. Nothing. D You are no better than prized D livestock. Call for him. Call, D tell him of your previous D circumstances and see what it D earns you...Solomon. D Eliza uses Solomon\\'s name quite pointedly as if to N underscore his true self. Solomon get her meaning. Yet N he says nothing. Again, pointedly: C ELIZA (CONT\\'D) D So, you\\'ve settled into your role D as Platt, then?

D At the same time came the D disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who D is the greatest in the kingdom of D heaven? O 80 80 S EXT. FORD PLANTATION - MORNING C -AUGUST, 1841- D It\\'s Sunday. The slaves are again gathered in the rose N garden near the front of the house to hear the word of N the Lord as read by Master Ford. C FORD D And Jesus called a little child D unto him, and set him in the midst D of them, And said, Verily I say D unto you, Except ye be converted, D and become as little children, ye D shall not enter into the kingdom D of heaven. N The phrase seems to trigger Eliza\\'s tears. She begins to N sob uncontrollably. N Mrs. Ford turns to Rachel in a hushed whisper- C MRS. FORD D I cannot have that kind of D depression about. N Solomon, pretending not to have heard, slowly turns to N Eliza with worry. N Ford continues to preach over Eliza\\'s keening. C FORD D But whoso shall offend one of D these little ones which believe in D me, it were better for him that a D millstone were hanged about his D neck, and that he were drowned in D the depth of the sea.

It is winter now, and very grey out D along the bayou. Ford and Tibeats - who we have seen N working around the WORK AREA - stand with Solomon, N Tibeats giving Solomon an inspection. Ford carries much N lament. C TIBEATS D Raise yer shirt. N Solomon does as instructed. Tibeats looks at Solomon\\'s N back, at the scars from lashings he bears. C TIBEATS (CONT\\'D) D Troublesome. C FORD D He\\'s a good carpenter and quick- D witted. C TIBEATS D I am familiar with his cleverness. C FORD D You won\\'t find a nigger more D humble. C TIBEATS D Ain\\'t found a nigger yet I cain\\'t D humble. N Tibeats heads off. Solomon, highly curious over the N preceding. C SOLOMON D Sir, have I done something wrong? C FORD D Not your concern, Platt. I say D with much...shame I have compiled D debts. I have long preached D austerity, but find myself D hypocritical in that regard. D You\\'ll be in the ownership of Mr. D Tibeats. You are his now. Serve D him as you\\'d serve me. C SOLOMON D Sir. C FORD D And your faithfulness will not be D forgotten. O (CONTINUED) O 52. O 81 CONTINUED: 81 C SOLOMON D Yes, sir. C FORD D Pride and want have been my sin. D Loss of you is but one of my D punishments. O 82 82 S EXT. FORD PLANATION - DAY S -END OF JANUARY, 1842- [OVER ONE DAY] N We see Solomon working as a carpenter, helping to erect a N Weaving House that stands off to the side of the S plantation\\'s Great House. N At the moment Solomon is nailing on siding. Tibeats N arrives and is immediately dissatisfied with the work. C TIBEATS D Make them boards flush. C SOLOMON D They are, sir. C TIBEATS D They is no such thing. N Solomon runs his hands over the boards. C SOLOMON D As smooth to the touch as a D yearling\\'s coat. C TIBEATS D Callin\\' me a liar, boy? C SOLOMON D Only a matter of perspective, sir. D From where you stand you may see D differently. But the hands are D not mistaken. I ask only that you D employ all your senses before D rendering judgement. N What\\'s Tibeats to do when faced with fact? All he can do N is spew invectives. C TIBEATS D You are a brute. You are a dog, D and no better for followin\\' D instruction. C SOLOMON D I\\'ll do as ordered, sir. O (CONTINUED) O 53. O 82 CONTINUED: 82 C TIBEATS D Then you\\'ll be up at daybreak. D You will procure a keg of nails D from Chapin and commence puttin\\' S on clapboards. N Tibeats wheels away. Solomon goes back to his work. N After a few moments Solomon notices a bit of commotion in S the drive of the great house. It involves an N inconsolable Eliza who is being herded by Sam onto a cart N DRIVEN BY A WHITE MAN. Mistress Ford and Rachel watch. N Solomon can only watch as the last connection to his days N as a free man is driven away to a location unknown. O 83 83 S EXT. WEAVING HOUSE - MORNING N It is day break. As ordered, Solomon is up and working. N Chapin is rolling a keg of nails off a handcart for N Solomon. C CHAPIN D If Tibeats prefers a different D size, I will endeavor to furnish D them, but you may use those until D further directed. C SOLOMON D Yes, sir. O 84 84 S EXT. WEAVING HOUSE - LATER N As the day gets on to mid-morning, the sun already baking N in the sky, Tibeats makes his way over to Solomon. Even N before arriving to Solomon his mien is one of N belligerence; out of sorts and something less than sober. C TIBEATS D I thought I told yah ta commence D ta puttin\\' on clapboards this D morn\\'. O (CONTINUED) O 54. O 84 CONTINUED: 84 C SOLOMON D Yes, master. I am about it. I D have begun on the other side of S the house. N Tibeats walks around to look over Solomon\\'s work. He is N picayune, as if purposefully looking for fault. C TIBEATS D Didn\\'t I tell yah last night to D get a keg of nails of Chapin? C SOLOMON D And so I did; and Chapin said he D would get another size for you, if D you wanted them when he came back D from the field. N Tibeats walks to the keg and kicks it. Moving toward N Solomon \"with a great passion:\" C TIBEATS D Goddamn yah! I thought yah knowed D somethin\\'! N Solomon, perhaps inspired by his moment with Eliza, is in N no mood for Tibeats. C SOLOMON D I did as instructed. If there\\'s D something wrong, then its wrong N with your instructions. C TIBEATS D Yah black bastard! Yah goddman D black bastard! N In an inconsolable rage, Tibeats runs off to the piazza N to fetch a whip. N Solomon looks around. He is alone other than Rachel and N Mistress Ford who, shocked by that which she witnesses, N runs out to the field to fetch Chapin. Solomon\\'s N instinct is to run, but he stands his ground as Tibeats N marches back whip in hand. C TIBEATS (CONT\\'D) D Strip yer clothes! D Solomon does no such thing. C TIBEATS (CONT\\'D) D Strip! C SOLOMON D I will not. N With \"concentrated vengeance,\" Tibeats springs for N Solomon, seizing him by the throat with one hand and O (CONTINUED) O 55. O 84 CONTINUED: (2) 84 N raising the whip with the other. Before he can strike N the blow, however, Solomon catches Tibeats by the collar N of his coat and pulls him in close. Reaching down, N Solomon grabs Tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back N with the other hand. Tibeats tumbles to the ground. A N violent struggle takes place as Solomon puts a foot to N Tibeats throat, and then in a frenzy of madness snatches N the whip from Tibeats and begins to strike him with the N handle again and again and again. C TIBEATS D Yew will not live ta see another D day, nigger! This is yer last, I D swear it! N Solomon ignores the threats, continues to beat Tibeats. N Blow after blow falling fast and heavy on Tibeats\\'s N wriggling form. The stiff stock of the whip wraps around N Tibeats\\'s cringing body until Solomon\\'s arm aches. N Tibeats\\'s cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and N then pleas for mercy: C TIBEATS (CONT\\'D) D Murder! It\\'s murder! Lord, God, D help me. God be merciful! N And then suddenly, Tibeats shrieks- C TIBEATS (CONT\\'D) D Papa I\\'m sorry! N Chapin comes RIDING IN FROM THE FIELD fast and hard. N Solomon strikes Tibeats a blow or two more, then delivers N a well-directed kick that sends Tibeats rolling over the N ground. C CHAPIN D What is the matter? N Tibeats struggles up and tries to present an air of N dignity and control while he keeps a demonic eye on N SOLOMON: C SOLOMON D Master Tibeats wants to whip me D for using the nails you gave me. C CHAPIN D What\\'s the matter with the nails? N With a mix of shame, anger and embarrassment, Tibeats N says, as if being exposed- C TIBEATS D They\\'re...they\\'re too large. C CHAPIN D I am overseer here. I told Platt D to use them, and E (MORE) O (CONTINUED) O 56. O 84 CONTINUED: (3) 84 C CHAPIN (CONT\\'D) D I shall furnish such nails as I D please. Do you understand that, D Mr. Tibeats? N Tibeats answer is in the grinding of his teeth and the N shaking of his fist. C TIBEATS D This ain\\'t done by half. I will D have flesh, and I will have all of D it. N Tibeats moves off toward, and then INTO THE HOUSE. N Chapin follows. A long moment, Solomon stands alone. He N looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee. N Anxiety mounts on his features. N A moment more, and Tibeats EXITS the house. He saddles N his horse and rides off to beat the devil. Or, worse, to N fetch him. N Chapin comes running back out of the house. He is N visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest. N Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off N an air of impending trouble. C CHAPIN D Do not stir. Do not attempt to D leave the plantation on any D account whatever. But if you run D there is no protecting you. C SOLOMON O SIR-- C CHAPIN D If you run, Platt, there is no D protecting you. Rachel...! N Chapin runs off to join Rachel. The two converse at a N distance from Solomon, then they head off for the log N kitchen. N Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is N to come. AND WE WAIT WITH HIM. And we wait, and we N continue to wait... Moment by moment, the dread of the N unexpected mounts. N Solomon\\'s eyes begin to well. He has beaten a white man, N and he knows that death awaits him. N A SLIGHT PRAYER TO THE HEAVENS BEGINS TO FORM IN HIS N THROAT, but he is too choked up to fully speak it. O (CONTINUED) O 57. O 84 CONTINUED: (4) 84 N Chapin has now returned to the piazza. He stands and N watches, but does not move to Solomon. N Solomon waits, and waits... N WE HEAR THE SOUND OF DISTANT HOOFS which grow louder and N louder in the manner of rolling thunder. It\\'s Tibeats. N He returns with two accomplices; RAMSAY and COOK. They N carry with them large whips and a coil of rope. C TIBEATS D Tha\\'s the one. Tha\\'s him. N Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with N perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence. Solomon N tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by N TIBEATS - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same N manner. In the meantime the other two have slipped a N cord within Solomon\\'s elbows, running it across his back N and tying it firmly. Solomon is then dragged toward a N peach tree. A lynching is in store. The naked horror of N it intensely palpable. N Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone. N Tears of fear flow down Solomon\\'s cheeks. He is on the N verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution, N he begins to struggle and fight. N A rope goes around Solomon\\'s neck, then is tossed over N the branch of the tree. The trio begin to hoist Solomon. N He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the N life is choked from him. N With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing N a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson .36 caliber N \"Holster\" pistols with 9\" barrels. Chapin moves with N determination toward the lynch mob. He is sharp and N matter of fact. With the guns in hand, he really doesn\\'t N need to be much more demonstrative. C CHAPIN D Gentlemen... Whoever moves that D nigger another foot from where he D stands is a dead man. I am D overseer of this plantation seven D years, and in the absence of D William Ford, my duty is to D protect his interests. Ford holds D a mortgage on Platt of four D hundred dollars. If you hang him, D he loses his debt. Until that is D canceled you have no claim to his D life. N Directing his attention to Ramsay and Cook: O (CONTINUED) O 58. O 84 CONTINUED: (5) 84 C CHAPIN (CONT\\'D) D As for you two, if you have any D regard for your own safety...I D say, begone! D Ramsay and Cook don\\'t need to be told twice. The pistols N Chapin\\'s gripping make the situation real clear. Without N further word, they mount their horses and ride away. N Tibeats remains, and his anger with him. C TIBEATS D Yah got no cause. Platt is mine, D and mine ta do with as I please. D Yah touch my property, I will \\'ave D yah strung up as well. N Tibeats mounts up and departs. There is a surreal moment N as Chapin\\'s not sure what to do about Solomon. He N chooses to do nothing. Solomon is left dangling by the N neck from the tree as Chapin calls to Sam in the N DISTANCE: C CHAPIN D Sam! Get the mule. You must ride D to Master Ford. Tell him to come D here at once without a single D moment\\'s delay. Tell him they are N trying to murder Platt. Hurry, D boy. Bring him back if you must D kill the mule to do so! C SAM D Yes, suh! N Sam mounts up and rides off, the mule demonstrating much N speed. O 85 85 S EXT. FORD PLANATION - LATER N HOURS HAVE PASSED. The sun is now at its apex. The sight N and smell of the red rose bush is more than vivid as N Solomon remains tied and dangling exactly where he was N left. The scene is both tranquil and horrific. Life on N the plantation continues. The OTHER SLAVES work in the N field. CHILDREN make their way playfully in the yard. N It should all underscore the fact that a black, hanging N even partially from a tree, is nothing unusual in this N time and space. O (CONTINUED) O 59. O 85 CONTINUED: 85 N Chapin walks back and forth with the pistols in his N hands. Clearly he fears Tibeats returning with more and N better assistance. And yet, he does nothing to alleviate N Solomon\\'s suffering. He heeds Tibeats words, and as N though caught up in the middle of nothing more than a N property dispute, he offers no further aid. N Solomon\\'s head lolls to one side. He looks toward the N sun. The bright light flares off the leaves and branches N of the tree from which Solomon hangs. The glare in N Solomon\\'s eyes offering him more pain than solace, but he N cannot help but look upward. As he does, his eyes N flutter between life and lifelessness... O 86 86 T OMIT S 87 EXT. FORD PLANATION - LATER 87 N Solomon continues to hang. By now he is drenched in N sweat, and nearly delirious with dehydration. His lips N dry and parched. He may not die from hanging, but he may N very well expire before the day is over. N Eventually Rachel comes over - timidly, and as though she N were acting contrary to orders - and offers a drink of N water from a tin cup, pouring it in Solomon\\'s mouth for N him. She then takes a small hand towel and dabs at the N water which clings to his lips. Rachel then retreats, N and leaves Solomon to hang. O 88 88 S EXT. FORD PLANATION - EVENING N The sun is just now arching for the horizon. Solomon N remains, as though his torture will not end. Ford, N trailed by Sam, finally comes riding up. He dismounts, N and moves swiftly over to Solomon. With great heartache: C FORD N Platt... My poor Platt. N Ford produces a blade and cuts Solomon loose. Solomon N attempts to carry himself, but he cannot. He falls to N the ground and passes out. O 89 89 S INT. FORD PLANATION/GREAT HOUSE - NIGHT N As we come into the scene, Solomon lays on a blanket on N the floor. Eventually, his eyes flutter, then open. He N is in the foyer of the Ford house. As he gets his N bearings, he looks around the interior. THE SPACE IS N HANDSOME, AND WELL DECORATED. It is sharp contrast to N the bleak surroundings, shacks and dungeons Solomon has N largely been accustom to during his time of slavery. It N will be the \"first and last time such a sumptuous resting N place was granted\" during his twelve years of bondage. O (CONTINUED) O 60. O 89 CONTINUED: 89 N Solomon doesn\\'t have much chance to luxuriate in his N surroundings. He hears a DOG BARKING just outside, and N is unnerved. Has Tibeats returned to finish what he N started? N From a study, Master Ford appears with a gun in hand. He N goes to the door, opens it and looks outside. He can see N nothing. Satisfied, Ford crosses back over to Solomon. N He is frank with Solomon regarding the situation. C FORD D I believe Tibeats is skulkin\\' D about the premises somewhere. He D wants you dead, and he will D attempt to have you so. It\\'s no D longer safe for you here. And I D don\\'t believe you will remain D passive if Tibeats attacks. I D have transferred my debt to Edwin D Epps. He will take charge of you. C SOLOMON E (desperate, urgent) D Master Ford, you must know; I am D not a slave. C FORD D I cannot hear that. C SOLOMON D Before I came to you I was a C freeman. C FORD D I am trying to save your life! D And...I have a debt to be mindful D of. That, now, is to Edwin Epps. D He is a hard man. Prides himself D on being a \"nigger breaker.\" But D truthfully I could find no others D who would have you. You\\'ve made a D reputation of yourself. Whatever D your circumstances, you are an D exceptional nigger, Platt. I fear D no good will come of it. O 90 90 S EXT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/BACK PORCH - DAY N -END OF JANUARY, 1842- N From the back porch, we come into the scene on EDWIN N EPPS; a repulsive and coarse man. His language gives N speedy and unequivocal evidence that he has never enjoyed D the advantages of an education. O (CONTINUED) O 61. O 90 CONTINUED: 90 N Epps reads the Bible to his slaves, eight of them N altogether. ABRAM; a tall, older slave of about sixty N years. WILEY, who is forty eight. PHEBE, who is married N to Wiley. BOB and HENRY who are Phebe\\'s children, EDWARD N and PATSEY. Patsey is young, just 23 years old...though N in the era, 23 not as young as in the present day. She D is the offspring of a \"Guinea nigger,\" brought over to N Cuba in a slave ship. She nearly brims with unconversant D sexuality. N MISTRESS EPPS, Epps\\'s wife, is also present. She sits N with, holds quite lovingly, some SLAVE CHILDREN. WITH N THEM SHE IS VERY \"MOTHERLY.\" We also see Epps\\'s overseer N TREACH. Treach constantly sports a LOADED PISTOL. N Though Epps reads the word of the Lord, he lacks the tone N of compassion with which Ford read. M EPPS D \"And that servant which knew his D Lord\\'s will...WHICH KNEW HIS D LORD\\'S WILL and prepared not N himself...PREPARED NOT HIMSELF, D neither did according to his will, D shall be beaten with many D stripes...\" D\\'ye hear that? D \"Stripes.\" That nigger that don\\'t D take care, that don\\'t obey his D lord - that\\'s his master - d\\'ye D see? - that \\'ere nigger shall be D beaten with many stripes. Now, D \"many\" signifies a great many. O Forty, a hundred, a hundred and N fifty lashes... That\\'s Scripter! O 91 91 S EXT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/FIELD - DAY N -AUGUST, 1842- N WE START THE SCENE WITH A PAIR OF BLACK HANDS N picking cotton ferociously. As we move out, we identify N PATSEY, a 23 year old striking black woman. The camera N moves out again to a wider shot. This reveals several N lines of slaves picking cotton, with Patsey way out in N the lead. N We cut to another pair of black hands. This time, N revealing SOLOMON, clumsy and unskilled hands, picking N cotton. A lash bears down on him. N It is August, \"cotton picking\" season. N We are looking out over a cotton field in full bloom. It N presents a visual purity, like an immaculate expanse of N light, new-fallen snow. The cotton grows from five to N seven feet high, each stalk having a great many branches O (CONTINUED) O 62. O 91 CONTINUED: 91 N shooting out in all directions and lapping each other N above the water furrow. N There is a slave to each side of the row. They have a N sack around their necks that hangs to the ground, the N mouth of the sack about breast high. Baskets are placed N at the end of the furrows. Slaves dump their sacks of N cotton in the baskets, then pick until their sacks are D again filled. C EDWARDS D Pick that cotton. Move along now. N THE SOUNDTRACK TO THE SCENE IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE N RUSTLE OF LABOR, THE MALE CICADAS BUGS \"TYMBALS\" IN THE N HEAT and a SPIRITUAL SUNG BY THE SLAVES. N Despite the heat, there is no stopping for water. The N slaves are \"driven\" by Edward, who is himself \"driven\" by N Treach. C TREACH D C\\'mon. Drive dem niggers. D Edward moves among the slaves, applying the whip to them D without regard. C EDWARD D Pick dat cotton. Move along now, D hear? O 92 92 S EXT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/GIN HOUSE - EVENING N The day\\'s work is done. The slaves are now assembled in N the gin house with their baskets of cotton which are N being weighed by Treach. There is anxiety among the N slave, the reason for which soon becomes apparent. C TREACH D Two hundred forty pounds for Bob. D EPPS D What yah got for James? C TREACH D Two hundred ninety five pounds. M EPPS D Tha\\'s real good, boy. Tha\\'s real D good. C TREACH D One hundred eighty two pounds for C Platt. D Epps does not look happy. Treach says again: O (CONTINUED) O 63. O 92 CONTINUED: 92 C TREACH (CONT\\'D) O One hundred eighty two. M EPPS D How much can even an average D nigger pick a day? C TREACH D Two hundred pounds. M EPPS D This nigger ain\\'t even average. N Epps pulls Solomon aside. C TREACH D Five hundred twelve pounds for C Patsey. M EPPS D Five hundred twelve. Yah men folk D got no shame lettin\\' Patsey out D pick yah? The day ain\\'t yet come D she swung lower than five hundred D pounds. Queen of the fields, she D is.

O 92 CONTINUED: (2) 92 M EPPS D How much he pick yesterday? C TREACH D Two hundred twenty nine pounds. N Wiley is pulled from the line, huddled with Solomon. O 93 93 S EXT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/YARD - EVENING N In the distance, a flogging is going on. Solomon, Phebe, N and Wiley are stripped, placed in a stockade and now N being given a perfunctory whipping delivered by ANOTHER N IDENTIFIED SLAVE. O 94 94 S EXT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION - EVENING N Evening, but the day is not yet done. Slaves attend N their various evening chores; feeding livestock, doing N laundry, cooking food. There is no respite from a N slave\\'s charge. O 95 95 S INT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT N A fire is kindled in the cabin. The slaves finally fix N their own dinner of corn meal. Corn is ground in a small N hand mill. The corn meal is mixed with a little water, N placed in the fire and baked. When it is \"done brown\" N the ashes are scraped off. Bacon is fried. As the N slaves eat, Abram goes on in great length and with much N emotion about General Jackson. C UNCLE ABRAM D Hold my words: General Jackson D will forever be immortalized. His D bravery will be handed down to the D last posterity. If ever there be D a stain upon \"raw militia,\" he D done wiped away on the eight of D January. I say da result a that D day\\'s battle is of \\'mo importance D to our grand nation than any D occurrence \\'fo or since. Great D man. Great man in deed. We all D need pray to Heavenly Father da D General reign over us always. O 96 96 S INT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT N The slaves are sleeping. There is a loud commotion. N Epps enters, drunkenly, forcing the slaves awake. O (CONTINUED) O 65. O 96 CONTINUED: 96 C EPPS D Get up! Get up, we dance tonight! D We will not waste the evenin\\' with D yer laziness. Get up. O 97 97 S INT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT N Despite the lateness of the hour, the slaves are up and N now fully dressed. They take up position in the middle N of the floor. They wait, poised like actors. Solomon N strikes up a tune; Henry joins in with a pan flute and N the slaves dance. They do so very wearily. The whole of N it certainly more torture than pleasure. N Epps, whip in hand: S EPPS D Where\\'s yah merriment? Move yer N feet. N As the slaves twirl about Epps keeps an attentive eye on N Patsey. It should be quite clear that his primary N motivation for holding dances is so that he may view N Patsey twirl about the floor. N This fact is not lost on Mistress Epps. A few moments of N Epps\\'s lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear. N Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a CARAFE. With all N her might she throws it at Patsey. It hits Patsey square N in the face. TOO THICK TO SHATTER, IT LEAVES HER BLOODY N AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR. The dancing, the music stop. N The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first N time they\\'ve seen as much from the Mistress. N Mistress Epps, screaming like a hellion: C MISTRESS EPPS D Sell her! M EPPS D C\\'mon, now. Wha\\'s this? C MISTRESS EPPS D You will sell the negress! C EPPS D You\\'re talkin\\' foolish. Sell D little Pats? She pick with more D vigor than any other nigger!

Oh, the idleness of D that yarn washes over me. Do not D set yourself up against Patsey, my D dear. That\\'s a wager on which you D will not profit. Calm yerself. D And settle for my affection, D \\'cause my affection you got. Or, D go. \\'Cause I will rid myself of D yah well before I do away with D her! N Mistress Epps stands irate, lost in fury and unable to N even think of what to do. Eventually, optionless, she N storms away. N For a few beats there is only the sound of Patsey N sobbing. C EPPS (CONT\\'D) D That damned woman! I won\\'t have D my mood spoiled. I will not. D Dance! N Epps sends the whip in Solomon\\'s direction. Solomon N responds by playing. N Treach literally drags the prone Patsey from the floor, N blood still spilling from her face. The slaves, as N ordered, return to dancing. O 98 98 S EXT.

S A101 A101 S EXT. ROAD - DAY N Solomon walks along a well-worn path, shopping bag draped N over one shoulder. We see his feet. As the walk slowly N gathers pace, Solomon suddenly turns left into dense N foliage. His tread is now a full blown sprint, trees N flash past as Solomon attacks his way through the woods. N The sound of branches cracking underneath. His feet, N heartbeat and breath almost deafening. He is desperate. N The violence of his advance abruptly stops, there is N silence. We see in a clearance a posse of patrollers, N preparing for a lynching of two young men. Solomon\\'s N eyes meet theirs. The two men look back at Solomon with N a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose N around their neck. Suddenly the bloodhounds start N barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of N Solomon. Solomon\\'s whole body shakes with anticipation. C PATROLLER E (AGGRESSIVELY) D Boy, where are you going? C SOLOMON E (almost tripping over E HIS WORDS) D To the store, Sir, to D Bartholomew\\'s. I was sent there S by Mistress Epps. N The patroller reaches out for Solomon\\'s free pass around N his neck, yanking him forward. He looks at it. C PATROLLER D Get there and get there quick. N The patroller kicks Solomon hard, sending him on his way. N Solomon walks on, looking one more time at the two young N men; again there is a moment of connection. N Solomon turns. The two men are hoisted up, kicking and N spitting, behind his shoulder. N Solomon finds himself back on the trail walking towards N Bartholomew\\'s, his face now full of shock and O (CONTINUED) O 68A. O A101 CONTINUED: A101 N trepidation. He walks, fighting to calm himself down. N We move behind him as he continues his journey, a lonely N figure. S 101 INT. BARTHOLOMEW\\'S - LATER 101 S A general store in the township of Holmesville. Solomon N stands at the counter as BARTHOLOMEW fills Mistress N Epps\\'s order. Among the items set before Solomon is a N QUANTITY OF FOOLSCAP. N The items are collected for Solomon and placed in a sack. N Solomon giving little thought to them other than getting N them back to the mistress. N As he turns, he glimpses the regalia of slave restraints, N of all different guises; chains, muzzles for sale. O 102 102 S EXT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - LATER N Solomon returns and delivers the items to the Mistress. C MISTRESS EPPS D Any trouble? C SOLOMON D No, ma\\'am. No trouble. O 103 103 T OMIT - MOVED TO A105 S 104 EXT. SHAW\\'S HOUSE - DAY 104 C -JULY, 1844- N Sitting on the Grand house\\'s Piazza, Patsey is having tea N with MISTRESS HARRIET SHAW, WHO IS A BLACK WOMAN. Though N once a slave, she is now comparatively refined though not N wholly so. The table where they sit is adorned with N white linens, and they are attended by a HOUSE NIGGER. N It makes for a tranquil surreal scene. N MASTER SHAW, A WHITE MAN, IS ON THE LAWN GROOMING A N HORSE. O 69. S A105 EXT. ROAD - DAY A105 N Solomon is running flat out along the road. Running as N though his life depended on getting to his destination in D beyond a timely manner. S B105 EXT. SHAW\\'S HOUSE - DAY B105 N Still running, slick with sweat, Solomon comes upon the S SHAW HOUSE. N As Solomon arrives: C MASTER SHAW D Platt Epps, good Sunday morning. C SOLOMON D Good morning, Master Shaw. I\\'ve D been sent by Master to retrieve D Patsey. May I approach? C MASTER SHAW D You may. N Solomon makes his way over to the piazza. C SOLOMON D Excuse me, Mistress Shaw. C MISTRESS SHAW D Nigger Platt. C SOLOMON D My apologies. Patsey, Master D wishes you to return. C PATSEY D Sabbath day. I\\'s free ta roam. C SOLOMON D Understood. But the Master sent D me running to fetch you, and said D no time should be wasted. C MISTRESS SHAW D Drink tea? C SOLOMON D Thank you, Mistress, but I don\\'t D dare. C MISTRESS SHAW D Would you knowed Massa Epps\\'s D consternation ta be any lessened D wit your timely return? Sit. Sit D and drink the tea that offered. O (CONTINUED) O 70. O B105 CONTINUED: B105 N Solomon knows better, but he sits and the Mistress has N tea poured for him. C MISTRESS SHAW (CONT\\'D) D What\\'n was Epps\\'s concern? C SOLOMON D ...I\\'d rather not say... C MISTRESS SHAW D L\\'il gossip on the Sabbath be D fine. All things in moderation. N Solomon is not sure what to say. He struggles to be as N diplomatic as possible. C SOLOMON D As you are aware, Master Epps can D be a man of a hard countenance. D There are times when it is D impossible to account for his D logic. You know he has ill D feelings toward your husband. C MISTRESS SHAW D He do. C SOLOMON D Master Epps has somehow come to D believe, as incorrectly as it may D be, that Master Shaw is... That D he is something of a lothario and D an unprincipled man. A misguided D belief born out of their mutual D competition as planters, no doubt. C MISTRESS SHAW D No doubt...if not born outta truth D itself. N The Mistress waves to Shaw. Shaw, unsuspecting of the N conversation, waves back. C SOLOMON D I\\'m certain Patsey\\'s well being is D Master Epps\\'s only concern. C MISTRESS SHAW D Nothin\\' Epps desire come outta D concern. C SOLOMON D I meant no disrespect. C MISTRESS SHAW D He ain\\'t heard you. O (CONTINUED) O 71. O B105 CONTINUED: (2) B105 C SOLOMON D I meant no disrespect to you, D Mistress. C MISTRESS SHAW D Ha! You worry for me? Got no D cause to worry for my D sensibilities. I ain\\'t felt the D end of a lash in \\'mo years than I D cain recall. Ain\\'t worked a D field, neither. Where one time I D served, now I got others servin\\' D me. The cost to my current D existence be Massa Shaw D broadcasting his affections, \\'n me D enjoyin\\' his pantomime of D fidelity. If that what keep me D from the cotton pickin\\' niggers, D that what it be. A small and D reasonable price to be paid \\'fo D sure. D Looking toward Patsey, speaking with great empathy: C MISTRESS SHAW (CONT\\'D) D I knowed what it like to be the D object of Massa\\'s predilections D and peculiarities. And I knowed D they can get expressed with D kindness or wit violence. A lusty D visit in the night, or a D visitation from the whip. And wit D my experience, if\\'n I can give D comfort, then comfort I give. And D you take comfort, Patsey; the Good D Lord will manage Epps. In His own D time the Good Lord will manage dem D all. Yes, Lordy, there\\'s a day D comin\\' that will burn as an oven. D It comin\\' as sure as the Lord is D just. When His will be done...the D curse on the Pharos is a poor D example of all that wait \\'fo the D plantation class. N Mistress Shaw turns her head to the side, catching a N slave\\'s attention. As she does so, the slave, a YOUNG N WOMAN, commences to pour tea. N As if to punctuate her thought, the Mistress takes a sip N of her tea. O 105 105 S EXT. EPPS\\'S PLANTATION - LATER N Solomon and Patsey are returning from Shaw\\'s. Waiting on N the porch of the Great House, a drunk Epps beckons for N Patsey, his lewd intentions obvious. O (CONTINUED) O 72. O 105 CONTINUED: 105 O EPPS D Pats...! Patsey! C SOLOMON D Do not look in his direction. D Continue on. N Epps does not care to be ignored. He lifts himself and N moves toward the pair in a rage. M EPPS D Patsey...! N Solomon moves between Epps and Patsey, cutting Epps off N as Patsey continues on. Playing up his \"ignorance\" of N THE SITUATION: C SOLOMON D Found her, Master, and brought her D back just as instructed. C EPPS D What\\'d you jus now tell her? N What\\'d you say to Pats? C SOLOMON D No words were spoken. None of D consequence. C EPPS D Lie! Damned liar! Saw you D talkin\\' with \\'er. Tell me! C SOLOMON D I cannot speak of what did not D occur. N Epps grabs Solomon. C EPPS D I\\'ll cut your black throat. N Solomon pulls away from Epps, RIPPING HIS SHIRT IN THE N PROCESS. Epps gives chase. Solomon begins to run around N the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance. Epps, N however is undeterred. He moves after Solomon as N speedily as he can, which isn\\'t very speedily at all. N And quickly he tires. Epps is forced to bend over and N suck air. Solomon maintains his distance, barely N breathing hard. His breath returned to him, Epps starts N up the chase again. Solomon runs on out of reach. N Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath... And now in N what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after N Solomon. Again, Epps\\'s vigor leaves him before he can N even get close to the slave. N Dropping down to the dirt, in a show of regret and piety: O (CONTINUED) O 73. O 105 CONTINUED: (2) 105 O EPPS (CONT\\'D) D Platt... Platt, liquor filled me. D I admit that it did, and I done D over reacted. It\\'s the Lord\\'s D day. Ain\\'t nothin\\' Christian in D us carryin\\' on like this. Help me D ta my feet, and let us both pray D to the Lord for forgiveness. N Epps extends a hand to Solomon. Cautiously, Solomon N moves close, but not too close. As Solomon draws within N striking distance, Epps lunges for him. He chases N Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more N drops down. And again offering a treaty: C EPPS (CONT\\'D) D I\\'m all done in, Platt. I have D met my limitations, and I ain\\'t D equal to \\'em. I concede to yah, D but in the name of valor, help yer D master to his feet. N Solomon cautiously moves closer to help. Again he is N attacked by Epps - this time by knife. Sort of. Epps is N too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade - and N chased far around the field by Epps. ALL OF THE N PRECEDING SHOULD BE MORE FUNNY THAN SHOCKING. A CHANGE N OF PACE FROM THE OTHERWISE NECESSARY BLEAKNESS OF SLAVE N LIFE. N Mistress Epps comes running from the house to the pair. C MISTRESS EPPS D What? Wha\\'s the fuss? C SOLOMON D A misunderstanding is all. It D began when I was sent to retrieve D Patsey from where she\\'d taken D sabbatical at Master Shaw\\'s. Upon D returning, Master Epps believed D Patsey and me to be in D conversation when we were not. I D tried to explain, but it lead to D all this. C MISTRESS EPPS D What is it? Ya cain\\'t remain the D Sabbath without her under your D eye? Ya are a no-account bastard. M EPPS D Hold a moment... C MISTRESS EPPS D A filthy, godless heathen. My bed D is too holy for yah ta share. O (CONTINUED) O 74. O 105 CONTINUED: (3) 105 M EPPS D Wha\\'s...wha\\'s he been tellin\\' yah? C MISTRESS EPPS D Of yer misbegotten ways.

D Discretion being the better part and all, Solomon remains D silent. C EPPS (CONT\\'D) D There; there\\'s all the truth he D got. Damned nigger. Damn yah. N Epps pushes his way past the Mistress. O 106 106 S EXT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/FIELD - DAY S -AUGUST, 1844- N With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are N working the field picking cotton. As before THEY SING A N SPIRITUAL, the only thing that distracts them from the N tedium at hand. N But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Henry N begin to falter before it... And eventually collapse N right in the dirt. Though the other slaves take note, N none move to help him. None dare. N From Treach rather matter of factly: C TREACH D Get him water. N Edward runs to fetch a gourd. He carries it to Henry, N DUMPS THE WATER ON HIM, BUT DOES NOT ACTUALLY GIVE HENRY N ANYTHING TO DRINK. N Roused, Henry rights himself. C EDWARD D Go\\'won. Git up. N Unsteadily, Henry lifts himself and goes back to picking N cotton. He joins in again with the spiritual, as if the N song is all that can keep him going. O 107 107 S INT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACKS - NIGHT N -OCTOBER, 1844- O (CONTINUED) O 75. O 107 CONTINUED: 107 N The slaves are asleep. Epps arrives, again without N knocking, with his whip in hand. The slaves stir. Uncle N ABRAM ASKS: C UNCLE ABRAM D We dance tonight, massa? N Epps remains quietly focused on Patsey. And it\\'s clear N from her apprehensive expression just what it is he\\'s N come looking for. This time there is no escaping it. As N if to acknowledge the badness to come, Phebe lightly N cries. O 108 108 S EXT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/SMOKE HOUSE - NIGHT N On top of a wood pile, in the back of the smoke house - N Epps shoves Patsey. He stops, stands as if gathering his N manhood, then he\\'s all over Patsey. He is rough and N clumsy. It looks like something between an awkward rape N and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter. N Patsey does not respond in any way other than to N continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain N as still as possible. If there is such a thing, she is N vicious with her passive aggressiveness. N Epps\\'s frustration mounts until - as the Mistress Shaw N had cautioned - he crosses the line from passion to N violence. He begins slapping Patsey to get a response N from her. When that fails, he punches her which only N leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey N MERCILESSLY. Still, she gives him nothing. Beaten, N Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep N breathing above her. The desire for sex now having left N him. N Epps heads from the field. Patsey is left where she is. O 109 109 S INT. BARTHOLOMEW\\'S - DAY S -NOVEMBER, 1844- N As before, Solomon waits as Bartholomew fills Mistress N Epps order. Among the items set before Solomon is N another quantity of foolscap. O 110 110 S EXT. ROAD - DAY N Solomon is making his way back to the Epps plantation. N He carries with him a sack filled with the goods from the N store. As he walks, SOLOMON LOOKS AROUND CASUALLY. When N he is certain he is alone, he sets down the sack, opens N it and appropriates A SINGLE SHEET OF THE PAPER which he N folds and places in his pocket. That done, he cinches up N the sack and continues on his way. O 76. O 111 OMIT 111 S 112 INT. EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - DAY 112 N Solomon takes the slip of paper and hides it within his N fiddle. Perhaps the safest place he can think of. He N acts as though he\\'s hiding away found gold. In reality N it\\'s more than that. For Solomon the paper is a first N step toward freedom. O 113 113 S INT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT C -DECEMBER, 1844- N It\\'s another night of Epps\\'s forced revelry. Coming in N quick from the previous scene, we go from Solomon holding N his fiddle, to playing it as the slaves are again made to N dance. N Mistress Epps brings out a tray of freshly baked N pastries. She sets them down on a table. C MISTRESS EPPS D A moment from the dancing. Come D sample what I baked for y\\'all. D The slaves, thankful for the rest as much as the food, N file toward the tray reciting a chorus of \"Thank you, N Mistress.\" As Patsey moves toward the pastries: C MISTRESS EPPS (CONT\\'D) D There\\'ll be none for you, Patsey. N Patsey merely turns away. Her non responsiveness, N however, serves only to incite the Mistress. Screaming: C MISTRESS EPPS (CONT\\'D) D Yah see that? Did yah see the D look of insolence she give me? M EPPS N Seen nothin\\' but her turn away. C MISTRESS EPPS D Are you blind or ignorant? It was D hot, hateful scorn. It filled D that black face. Yah tell me yah D did\\'n see it, then yah choose not D to look, or yah sayin\\' I lie. M EPPS D Whatever it was, it passed. C MISTRESS EPPS D Is that how yah are with the D niggers? Let every ill thought D fester inside \\'em. Look at \\'em. E (MORE) (CONTINUED) O 77. O 113 CONTINUED: 113 C MISTRESS EPPS (CONT\\'D) D They foul with it; foul with their D hate. You let it be, it\\'ll come D back to us in the dark a night. D Yah want that? Yah want them D black animals to leave us gut like D pigs in our own sleep? D Epps isn\\'t sure how to respond to the inchoate berating. D It\\'s an invitation for the Mistress to continue. C MISTRESS EPPS (CONT\\'D) D You are manless. A damned eunuch D if ever there was. And if yah D won\\'t stand for me, I\\'d pray you\\'d D at least be a credit to yer own D kind and beat every foul thought D from \\'em. N Epps does nothing. The Mistress lets her anger loose. N She moves quickly to Patsey, DRIVES HER NAILS INTO THE N PATSEY\\'S FACE AND DRAWS THEM DOWN ACROSS HER FEATURES. N FIVE DEEP AND BLOODY GASHES ARE LEFT IN PATSEY\\'S SKIN, N the moment marked with appropriate screams. Patsey N collapses on the floor, covering her bleeding face. C MISTRESS EPPS (CONT\\'D) D Beat it from \\'em! D Thoroughly cuckolded by the Mistress\\'s actions, Epps N takes his whip and pulls Patsey out of the house. His N intentions are plain. N All the slaves remain silent. The Mistress, however, N displaying high satisfaction, entreats the others: C MISTRESS EPPS (CONT\\'D) D Eat. Fill yourselves. ...And N then we dance. N The slaves eat, but without a hint of levity. O 114 114 S INT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT N We come up on the slaves who lay sleeping. All except N for Patsey. She rises from her bedding, goes to a corner N of the cabin and removes something from a secretive N location. She then moves over to Platt. C PATSEY D Platt... Platt, you awake? C SOLOMON D I am. C PATSEY D I have a request; an act of D kindness. O (CONTINUED) O 78. O 114 CONTINUED: 114 N Patsey displays what she took from hiding. It is a N LADY\\'S FINGER RING. C PATSEY (CONT\\'D) D I secreted it from the Mistress. C SOLOMON D Return it! C PATSEY D It yours, Platt. C SOLOMON D For what cause? C PATSEY D All I ask: end my life. Take my D body to the margin of the swamp-- N Solomon looks at Patsey as though she were insane. C SOLOMON D No. C PATSEY D Take me by the throat. Hold me D low in the water until I\\'s still D \\'n without life. Bury me in a D lonely place of dyin\\'. C SOLOMON D No! I will do no such thing. D The...the gory detail with which D YOU SPEAK-- C PATSEY D I thought on it long and hard. C SOLOMON D It is melancholia, nothing more. D How does such despair even come to D you? C PATSEY D How can you not know? I got no D comfort in this life. If I cain\\'t D buy mercy from yah, I\\'ll beg it. C SOLOMON D There are others. Beg them. C PATSEY D I\\'m begging you! C SOLOMON D Why? Why would you consign me to D damnation with such an un-Godly O request? O (CONTINUED) O 79. O 114 CONTINUED: (2) 114 C PATSEY D There is God here! God is D merciful, and He forgive merciful D acts. Won\\'t be no hell for you. D Do it. Do what I ain\\'t got the D strength ta do myself. D Solomon says nothing. Clearly he\\'s not about to do the N deed. With nothing else to do, knowing she is damned N with every breath she draws, Patsey crawls back to her N spot on the floor and lays herself down. T BLACK O 115 115 S EXT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/FIELD - DAY C -JULY, 1846- S Hard times on the planation. Where previously the field D in bloom was a carpet of white, it is now patchy and D under grown. N The slaves move through the field picking not cotton, but D rather COTTON WORMS from the plants. The cotton worms D have dined on the cotton and nearly destroyed the crop. N We see the cotton worms in extreme close-up, moving among N and destroying the cotton crop. N Epps is beside himself as he looks out over his ruined C field. C EPPS D It is a plague. C TREACH (O.S.) D Cotton worm. M EPPS D A plague! It\\'s damn Biblical.

O 116 116 T RE-OMIT S 117 EXT. JUDGE TURNER\\'S PLANTATION - EVENING 117 S -OCTOBER, 1846- N Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon sit in the back of a N cart. SOLOMON HAS HIS FIDDLE WITH HIM. Epps has N delivered the men to JUDGE TURNER, a distinguished man N and extensive planter whose large estate is situated on S Bayou Salle within a few miles of the gulf. Epps and N Turner stand off to one side engaged in bargaining as N Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon wait and watch. N One of the slaves whisper under their breath. C EPPS\\' SLAVE D I hear cutting cane is twice as D hard as picking cotton. C BOB D But at least we\\'ll be away from D Master Epps. C UNCLE ABRAM D Boy, you two have no sense. N Epps returns to his slaves and gives a parting D salutation. O EPPS D Yer Judge Turner\\'s for the season. D More if need be, until my crop D return. Yah\\'ll bring no D disrespect to me, and yah\\'ll bring D no biblical plagues to him. Be D decent, ere mark my words, I will D deliver an ungodly whippin\\'. O 118 118 S INT. SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT O (CONTINUED) O 81. O 118 CONTINUED: 118 N Slaves are crammed into the shack - LITERALLY ON TOP OF N EACH OTHER - as they try to sleep. Some lay, some sit N up. Packed in like cattle, there is barely room to move N let alone draw a deep, clean breath. There is a real N risk of suffocating in the mass. Some cough and wheeze. N A CHILD CRIES... N Among them is Solomon who must believe at this point that N his life has reached its very lowest point. The odds of N survival are slight, let alone the chance of actually N ever returning to his family. This clearly weighs on him N as he struggles to find anything like comfortable space N in the pen. O 119 119 S EXT. CANE FIELDS - DAY N An OVERSEER is explaining to the new slaves - SOLOMON N AMONG THEM - how to cultivate cane. WITH A KNIFE IN HAND N he demonstrates the process: C OVERSEER D Draw the cane from the rick, cut D the top and flags from the stalk, D understand? Leave only that part D which is sound and healthy. Cast D off the rest... O 120 120 S EXT. CANE FIELDS - DAY C -NOVEMBER, 1846- N ABOUT THIRTY SLAVES are working the field. They are N divided into THREE GANGS. The first which draw the cane, N the next lay the cane in the drill, the last then hoe the N rows after. N Solomon is among a gang that draws and cuts, and he moves N with speed and skill. Certainly more so than he N displayed picking cotton. N Standing with his overseer, Judge Turner watches. O 121 121 S INT. SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT N Again, the slaves have been herded into the shack and N pressed together. N As he tries to rest - sleep is nearly impossible - N Solomon finds himself face to face with a woman, ANNA. N She is awake. For a few beats she avoids eye contact N with Solomon. She seems, like Solomon, to be N unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened N by them. Eventually her eyes meet Solomon\\'s. She makes N no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes. N Whatever\\'s next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely N stand to face. Fear, proximity... They drive her hand O (CONTINUED) O 81A. O 121 CONTINUED: 121 D to Solomon\\'s. After a moment of seemingly reacquainting N herself with genuine human contact, the woman TAKES O (CONTINUED) O 82. O 121 CONTINUED: (2) 121 N SOLOMON\\'S HAND AND PRESSES IT TO HER BREAST. Solomon N tries to jerk his hand away, but ANNA HOLDS IT IN PLACE. N Manipulating Solomon\\'s hand, she begins to massage her N breast. Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act - N really, neither does Anna. THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE N ANNA IS JUST SO VERY, VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT, N FOR THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE AND LIKE A PERSON RATHER THAN N AN ANIMAL THAT EMOTIONALLY SHE IS WILLING TO ENGAGE N SOLOMON. N The need quickly compounds. Anna presses her lips to N Solomon\\'s. Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER N DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS. Solomon, with slightly more N compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO N MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND. The act remains more N perfunctory than passionate. N We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual N release. But more - or substantially less - than joyous N sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against N reality. But the feeling quickly fades. All that N remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret. N And there is shame, too. This is put on display as Anna N turns away from Solomon. As quickly as it began, it is N as though the act had not happened at all. O 122 122 T OMIT S 123 EXT. JUDGE TURNER\\'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - EVENING 123 N Solomon waits outside the house on the porch. A house N servant - ZACHARY - approaches and admonishes Solomon. C ZACHARY D Off the porch. Get off. N Like a dog shooed away, Solomon steps down. N Eventually Judge Turner exits the house and crosses to N Solomon. C SOLOMON D ...Sir... C JUDGE TURNER D Platt is it? Have you cultivated D cane previously? C SOLOMON D No, sir, I have not. C JUDGE TURNER D You take to it quite naturally. D Are you educated? O (CONTINUED) O 83. O 123 CONTINUED: 123 C SOLOMON D Niggers are hired to work, not to D read and write. N Turner gives that a bit of consideration as he gives N Solomon a wary looking over. C JUDGE TURNER D You play the fiddle? C SOLOMON D I do. C JUDGE TURNER D Willard Yarney, a planter up the D bayou, celebrates his anniversary D in a three week\\'s time. I will D hold out your name to him. What D you earn is yours to keep. C SOLOMON D Sir. C JUDGE TURNER D Mind yourself, Platt. C SOLOMON D Yes, sir. S 124 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - LATER (MOVED FROM 124) 124 N Work over, the slaves congregate to eat. N As Solomon eats, he takes note of the JUICE FROM SOME N BERRIES ON HIS PLATE. S 125 EXT. TURNER\\'S PLANTATION - EVENING (MOVED FROM 125) 125 N Solomon plays with a piece of cane, fashions it into some N kind of writing tool, testing it in the mud. He then N brushes over the dirt with his hand. O 84. S 126 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT (MOVED FROM 126) 126 N Secreted away out near the edge of the bayou and sitting N by a small fire, Solomon takes the slip of paper from his N fiddle. It is yellowed, showing age, but still usable. N Dipping the piece of cane - a quill - into the crushed N berries, Solomon attempts to write a bit on the paper. N The berry juice, too free-flowing, is unusable as ink. N Solomon returns the paper to the fiddle. He has some N scraps of food with him, which he snacks on. O A127 A127 T OMITTED S A127A INT. SLAVE SHACK - DAY A127A N We see a sharp object scratching onto a surface. The N tool moves on to form another mark. The sound is N repetitive and almost unbearable. As we move out, we see N the names Anne, Margaret, Alonzo. They are engraved onto N the violin, in the hidden area where Solomon would rest N his chin. N Solomon looks at it for a moment, moving his fingertips N across the engraving. His face full of loss. N Sadly, he lifts his instrument under his chin and leaning N his head to the side as if to play. S 127 INT. YARNEY\\'S HOUSE - EVENING 127 N A party has commenced at the noble home of one MR. N YARNEY. A group of REVELERS have gathered and are on the N dance floor, in fancy dress. Their faces are covered with N a variation of decorative masks. The party is a feast of N celebration. As entertainment, SOLOMON ACCOMPANIES A N GROUP OF MUSICIANS, no more than three. And as he does N so, they all play with jovial liveliness. Clearly a good N time is being had by all. O 128 128 S EXT. ROAD - NIGHT N His playing done for the evening, Solomon is returning to N Judge Turner\\'s on foot. There is only the moonlight with N which to light the way. As he walks, Solomon eats from a N HEARTY CHUCK OF BREAD. Obviously part of his haul from N the evening. Solomon again hears noises coming from the N brush just up ahead of him. Solomon tears off some of N the bread, kneels and holds it out before him. C SOLOMON D C\\'mere. C\\'mon, boy. O (CONTINUED) O 85. O 128 CONTINUED: 128 N This time, there is no dog. Instead, from the dark and N the brush step TWO BLACK MEN. Solomon stands. He looks N the men over - their clothes tatters and they themselves N covered in dirt. It becomes quite clear they are not N just slaves. A fact confirmed when they step menacingly N toward Solomon, ONE WITH A SHIV IN HAND. N At first it seems they want Solomon\\'s food or money. N Worse, THEY GO FOR HIS FIDDLE. N Solomon has but a moment to brace himself before he is N attacked, TAKING A CUT TO THE ARM. Solomon fights back, N PICKING UP A PINE KNOT and striking his attacker over the N head. That takes the fight out of him, and both men N retreat back the way they came leaving Solomon be.

TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT 130 S -FEBRUARY/MARCH, 1847- N Alone out on the edge of the Bayou, Solomon is playing a N low air on his violin WHILE SNACKING ON SCRAPS OF BACON. N As he plays, something appears in the distance. From the N edge of the bayou, coming forth like an apparition arisen N from the earth, is CELESTE. She is a young woman of N about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks. N \"IT REQUIRED CLOSE INSPECTION TO DISTINGUISH IN HER N FEATURE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD.\" Beyond N that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely. N Dressed in a white gown, she emerges from the water. N Draped on her dress, her period. A line in her skirt. N It\\'s very visible, but not shocking. A ribbon of red in N her dress. N Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation. As N Solomon, startled, takes her in, Celeste says quite N PLAINLY: C CELESTE D I am hungry. Give me food. C SOLOMON D Who are you? C CELESTE D I\\'m hungry. N Solomon gives Celeste some of his food. Celeste, N famished, devours it. C SOLOMON D What is your name? C CELESTE D My name is Celeste.

But Celeste tricked dem D \\'n alight in the middle of the day D wit the sun up at its highest.

There are sounds N and echoes - some in the distance, some perhaps moving N closer - which, moment by moment, become more and more N frightening. Soon, Solomon realizes he is in quite N literally over his head; the water first chest deep, then N neck deep.

N In that moment Solomon is quite certain he is nearly N done; that he will not find land, nor aid and that this N is his final moment. His panic should be that tangible. N It is either force of will, or survival instinct...or N maybe just pure luck that carries Solomon on until he N reaches first muddy ground, then firm footing. Hauling N himself onto the swamps edge, Solomon finally collapses N in a drenched, worn heap. His life spared, but Celeste N never to be seen again. N BLACK O 139 139 S EXT.

D Oh, did you beguile him, Platt, D with your slick nigger ways? D Well, yah won\\'t stand idle, boy. D Not on my land. Much work to do. D Days of old long since, eh? D Joyous! Joyous indeed! N Throughout Epps\\'s welcome, Solomon\\'s focus is on Patsey N who is lined up with the other slaves. SHE IS NOW MORE N HAGGARD THAN WHEN WE LAST SAW HER. Her face and arms N display many new scars. It\\'s clear that in the N intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping N boy for Epps and the Mistress. O 94. S 140 EXT. EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/COTTON FIELD - DAY 140 C -JULY, 1847- N The slaves are out working on the field. White hands N appear, picking cotton: ARMSBY.

C ARMSBY (CONT\\'D) D I became a little too dependant on D the whisky, a little too D undependable on the job. Before D you say I\\'m just a sorry drunkard, D let me state my case: As reliable D employment as overseeing is, it\\'s D no easy chore on the spirit. I D say no man of conscious can take D the lash to another human day in, D and day out without shredding at D his own self. Takes him to a D place where he either makes D excuses within his mind to be D unaffected... Or finds some way D to trample his guilty sensations. D Well, I trampled. N Armsby takes a drink. C ARMSBY (CONT\\'D) D And with frequency. C SOLOMON D Where is your place of birth? C ARMSBY D Maryland. Have you traveled D there? C SOLOMON D ...I cannot say that I have. C ARMSBY D Fine country. More seasonal than D the bayou. A deal less humid. C SOLOMON D Why did you leave it? C ARMSBY D To make my fortune, of course.

MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/FIELD - DAY 144 N With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are N working the field picking cotton. As before they sing a N spiritual, the only thing that distracts them from the N tedium at hand. N But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Uncle N Abram begin to falter and finally drop down to the N ground. N Treach calls to Edward: C TREACH D Get him water. N Edward runs to fetch water which he carries to Abram and N DUMPS ON HIM...BUT ABRAM DOES NOT RISE. DOES NOT MOVE.

We are at the slaves\\' cemetery, N a mixture of crude crosses and unsettled ground. N Solomon, Bob and Henry, now much visually older than when N we first saw them, are digging a grave in the dirt. The N uncovered body of Abram lays near. Having dug down an N appropriate distance, the three men take the body and, N very unceremoniously, place it into the ground. Holding O (CONTINUED) O 98.

Again the singer continues, N \"where John baptized three.\" N The same faces we have seen on Epps\\' plantation, but now N filled with rapture, appear. It\\'s as if the voices have N created a new form of awakening and presence. It seems to N transcend and translate in a strange way, joy. A joy N which has un-yet been seen on screen. A joy which has N been hidden, but a joy which is undoubtedly there. It\\'s N captivating, infectious. N This should be a moving part of the film, which stirs the N audience and, for a moment, relieves them of the N seemingly chastising environment. N The singer continues, \"Well some say John was a Baptist, N some say John was a Jew, but I say John was a preacher, N because the Bible says so too, preach on Johnny.\" And N with that, the rest of the congregation chant \"I believe.

A few picayunes, D but all I have in the world. I D promise them to you if you will do D me the favor I require. But I beg D you not to expose me if you cannot D grant the request. C ARMSBY D What do you ask? C SOLOMON D First, your word, sir. C ARMSBY D On my honor. C SOLOMON D It is a simple enough request. I D ask only that you deposit a letter D in the Marksville post office. D And that you keep the action an D inviolable secret forever. The D details of the letter are of no D consequence. Even at that, there D would be an imposition of much D pain and suffering were it known I D was the author. A patron is what D I require, sir. C ARMSBY D Where\\'s the letter now? C SOLOMON D ...It is not yet written. I will D have it in a day. Two at most, my D skill with composition as poor as D it is. N Armsby considers the request. C ARMSBY D I will do it.

For a moment N there\\'s curiosity; is he there for a dance, for N Patsey...? N Looking right to Solomon: D EPPS D Get up. N Solomon does. Epps heads back out into the dark. He N says nothing, but his directive is clear: Follow me. S 153 EXT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - CONTINUOUS 153 N Solomon comes out into the dark. Nearly hidden in the N shadows is a bitter Epps. Despite the lack of light, N Epps\\'s malevolence is quite clear. His whip attached to N his hip.

The slaves are left to themselves to N do their own chores. At the moment the female slaves are N washing their clothes in large cauldrons, slapping their N clothes against washing boards and hanging them up to dry N near to their living quarters behind the plantation. It N is a sight of ritual. Missing from the field of labor is N Patsey, for whom Epps hollers. M EPPS D Patsey... Patsey! D A drunk Epps asks of the slaves: C EPPS (CONT\\'D) D Where is she? Where is Patsey? D No one answers. C EPPS (CONT\\'D) D Talk, Damn you! C PHEBE D We know nothin\\' of her, Massa. C EPPS D The hell you don\\'t! You know D where she is! She run off, ain\\'t D she?

There is nothing for them to N say. They don\\'t know where she is. Eventually Epps N drops into true sorrow. S EPPS (CONT\\'D) D She gone... My Pats gone. O 156 156 S EXT. EPPS\\'S PLANTATION - LATER N Epps sits on the piazza looking quite forlorn. He looks N up only to see PATSEY RETURNING TO THE PLANTATION. Epps N steps up to greet her, with anger rather than relief. N As they hear his angry voice, the slaves step around from N where they are hanging their laundry to dry. Treach is N near as well. M EPPS D Run off. Run off, did you? C PATSEY M MASSA EPPS-- C EPPS D You miserable wench! Where you D been? C PATSEY D I been nowhere. M EPPS D Lies to your misdeeds! C PATSEY D The Sabbath day, Massa.

N Epps goes to strike Solomon, but Patsey pulls his arm D back. C PATSEY D Do not strike him. I went to D Massa Shaw\\'s plantation! M EPPS D Yah admit it. C PATSEY D Freely. And you know why. N Patsey takes soap from the pocket of her dress. C PATSEY (CONT\\'D) D I got this from Mistress Shaw. D Mistress Epps won\\'t even grant me D no soap ta clean with.

O 156 CONTINUED: (3) 156 N Treach runs quickly to the tool shed. In short order he N returns with the rope in hand. C EPPS (CONT\\'D) D Strip her. Strike her bare \\'n D lash her to the post. N Mistress Epps has now come from the Great House. She N gazes on the scene with an air of heartless satisfaction. N Now tied to the post, Epps stands behind Patsey with his N whip. C EPPS (CONT\\'D) D Yah done this to yerself, Pats! D Epps hoists the whip to strike, holds it high...but no D matter his rage, Epps cannot bring himself to deliver the N blow. He looks to Mistress Epps who now stands gloating N and spurring him on. C MISTRESS EPPS D Do it! Strike the life from her. N Epps again hoists the whip. It trembles in his hand N ahead of the act... But he does not have it in him to N deliver such a beating. Turning to Solomon, thrusting N the whip at him: M EPPS D Beat her. N Solomon doesn\\'t move. Epps shoves the whip into his N hand. C EPPS (CONT\\'D) D Give her the whip. Give it all to D her! N Patsey, begging to Solomon: C PATSEY D I\\'d rather it you, Platt. D EPPS D Strike her, or yah\\'ll get the D same! O (CONTINUED) O 109. O 156 CONTINUED: (4) 156 N Solomon takes a step back. He unfurls the whip... He N begins to whip Patsey. Lash after lash, Patsey squirms N before it. Epps eyes fill with tears, he is nearly too N distraught to watch. N But the Mistress... She is not satisfied with Solomon\\'s N half-hearted effort. C MISTRESS EPPS D He pantomimes. There ain\\'t barely D a welt on her. That\\'s what your D niggers make of yah; a fool fer D the takin\\'. N Epps\\'s grief is replaced by fury. EPPS GRABS THE PISTOL N FROM TREACH\\'S HOLSTER and draws down on the slaves. C EPPS D Yah will strike her. Yah will D strike her until her flesh is rent D and meat and blood flow equal, or D I will kill every nigger in my D sight! D Solomon can\\'t strike a blow, even if it means his life. N But from the ground, from Patsey: C PATSEY D Do it, Platt. Don\\'t stop until I D am dead. N What else can he do? Solomon begins to whip, to truly N whip Patsey. Her back welts, then tears... Patsey N screams in agony. Solomon strikes again and again... N After a full thirty lashes Solomon looks to Epps, who is N not satisfied. C EPPS D Until I say no more! I ain\\'t said D nothing! N Solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times. By now, as N promised, Patsey\\'s back has been reduced to LITTLE MORE N THAN TORN MEAT AND BLOOD. N Finally, Solomon holds low the whip. He can and will do N no more. C EPPS (CONT\\'D) D Strike her! Strike her! D Solomon will not. Epps takes up the whip and whips N Patsey with \"ten fold\" greater force than he had. The D painfully loud and angry curses of Epps load the air. N Patsey by now is terribly lacerated, literally flayed. D The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and N dropped upon the ground. At length Patsey ceases N struggling. Her head sinks listlessly on the ground. O (CONTINUED) O 110. O 156 CONTINUED: (5) 156 N Her screams and supplications gradually decrease and die N away into a low moan. It would seem that she was dying. N Solomon, screaming at Epps: C SOLOMON D Thou devil! Sooner or later, D somewhere in the course of eternal D justice thou shalt answer for this D sin! D Though Epps fronts rage, there should be underlying N anguish for what he has done to his beloved Pats. C EPPS D No sin! There is no sin! A man D does how he pleases with his D property. At the moment, Platt, I D am of great pleasure. You be D goddamn careful I don\\'t come to D wantin\\' to lightenin\\' my mood no D further. N By contrast to this horror, the field of cotton smiles in N the warm sunlight. The birds chirp merrily amidst the N foliage of the tress. Peace and happiness seems to reign N everywhere. N Everywhere else. N Epps leaves Patsey to herself. He says not a word to the N Mistress as he passes. The Mistress herself heads back N into the house. N Solomon unties Patsey, lifts her and takes her to the S cabin. O 157 157 S INT. CABIN - LATER N Patsey is laid on some boards where she remains for a N long time with eyes closed and groaning in agony. Phebe N applies melted tallow to her wounds, and all try to N assist and console her. N In time Patsey opens her eyes. She looks to Solomon. N She does not say a word. She just looks at him...and N then her eyes close again. O 158 158 T MOVED TO A155 O 159 MOVED TO B155 159 O 111. S 160 INT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE/ADDITION - 160 N EVENING C -APRIL, 1852- N Solomon and Bass are working together alone on the N extension. From the amount of work that\\'s been done on D it, it should be obvious that days have now passed. N Solomon makes a cautious approach to Bass. As casually N as he can he inquires: C SOLOMON D Master Bass, I want to ask you D what part of the country you came D from? C BASS D No part of this land. I was born D in Canada. Now guess where that D is. C SOLOMON D Oh, I know where Canada is. I D have been there myself. C BASS D Have you? C SOLOMON D Montreal and Kingston and D Queenston and a great many places. D And I have been in York state, D too. Buffalo and Rochester and D Albany, and can tell you the names D of the villages on the Erie canal D and the Champlain canal. N Bass gives Solomon a long and curious stare. C BASS D Well traveled for a slave. How D came you here? C SOLOMON D Master Bass, if justice had been D done I never would have been here. C BASS D How\\'s this? Tell me all about it. C SOLOMON D I am afraid to tell you, though I D don\\'t believe you would tell D Master Epps if I should. C BASS D Every word you speak is a profound D secret. O (CONTINUED) O 112-115. O 160 CONTINUED: 160 N Solomon holds a moment. Hasn\\'t he heard the same promise N before? Prior to Solomon stating his case, WE FADE TO: S 161 INT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION / ADDITION - DAY 161 N Hours have passed. Bass reflects on the story that Epps N has told in the intervening. C BASS D How many years all told? C SOLOMON D Just nearly...just passed eleven. C BASS D Your story is...it is amazing, and D in no good way. C SOLOMON D Do you believe, sir, in justice as D you have said? C BASS D I do. C SOLOMON D That slavery is an evil that D should befall none? C BASS D I believe so. C SOLOMON D If you truly do, I would ask...I D would beg that you write my D friends in the north, acquainting D them with my situation and D beseeching them to forward free D papers, or take such steps as they D might consider proper to secure my D release. N Bass looks at Solomon, holding his gaze for more than a N prolonged beat. C SOLOMON (CONT\\'D) D My daughter Margaret is possibly D now 19 and my son Alonzo, 16. I D miss them so. It would be an D unspeakable happiness to clasp my D wife and my family again. N Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and N looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the N conversation by work. They both lift it toward the N floorboards. Finally Bass speaks. O (CONTINUED) O 116. O 161 CONTINUED: 161 C BASS D I have always forgone D relationships and family. I did D once have a sweetheart who I loved D deeply. N Bass points to a measuring tool, which Solomon N immediately hands over. C BASS (CONT\\'D) D But that was a long, long time D ago. I\\'ve been traveling this D country for the best part of D twenty years. My freedom is D everything. The fact that I can D walk out of here tomorrow gives me D most pleasure. I see the aching in D your eyes, the pain of not being D attached to your loved ones. My D life doesn\\'t mean much to anyone, D but it seems your life means a lot D to a lot of people. What you have D just said to me scares me, and I D must say, sir, I am afraid. Not D just for you, but for me. N They continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison. N Solomon, slightly confused. C BASS (CONT\\'D) D I will write your letter sir, for D if I could bring freedom to you, D it will be more than a pleasure. D It will be a duty. Now, would you D be so kind as to pass me those D nails, sir. D We pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the D unfinished structure. They continue to work, as if the D conversation had never occurred. O 162 162 T OMIT O 163 OMIT 163 O 164 OMIT 164 M A165 EXT. SWAMP TBD A165 N Solomon walks a path he has walked a thousand times or N more on his way back from Bartholomew\\'s - sack familiarly N slung over his right shoulder. Drearily he walks. His N eyes acknowledge something we yet cannot see to his left. N Almost simultaneously, his eyes retract back to the path O (CONTINUED) O 116A. S A165 CONTINUED: A165 N towards Epps\\'. As he passes out of shot, the evidence of N what he was looking at is revealed. N FEET hang at the top right hand corner of the frame. A N woman, who has been lynched. O 165 165 S EXT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/ADDITION - DAY N -SEPTEMBER, 1852- N SLOW DISSOLVE N To a now virtually complete, half-painted white gazebo. N Slaves continue to work on it. As they do so, Bass peels N away from the structure to have an overview. He beckons N Solomon toward him, out of earshot from the slaves who N are continuing to work on the gazebo. As Solomon N approaches, Bass shouts- C BASS D And bring those markers! N Solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and N approaches Bass. C BASS (CONT\\'D) D No letter yet. C SOLOMON D You are certain? N Bass takes a marker from Solomon and slides it into the N earth. C BASS D I have inquired thoroughly. More D than is safe for either of us. N Bass takes another and pokes it into the ground, N improvising a pathway towards the gazebo. C BASS (CONT\\'D) D Solomon...I have a job or two on D hand which will be completed D shortly... The work here has D grown sparse. O (CONTINUED) O 117. O 165 CONTINUED: 165 N Bass doesn\\'t need to spell things out for Solomon. N Solomon\\'s understanding of the finality of the situation D should be very clear. C BASS (CONT\\'D) D You must know, wherever I am I D will press your cause. C SOLOMON D Five months. On top of these D years. No cause remains. C BASS D If there is any chance... C SOLOMON D Mr. Bass... C BASS D I will continue to write your D PEOPLE-- C SOLOMON D Go home knowing you have tried. N The weight of defeat should hang very heavily with both N men. Nothing more to do, nothing more to say BASS TAKES N SOLOMON\\'S HAND, GRIPS IT FIRMLY, BUT LOW AND N SURREPTITIOUSLY knowing full well he cannot be seen N making contact with a slave. But in the strength of N their collective grip, in the emotion in which they hold N each other\\'s eyes, we should be able to easily see how N greatly Bass wanted to be able to help Solomon. Equally, N we can see the depth of regard Solomon has for Bass. The N moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither N man can openly speak his regret or thanks. A moment N longer, and then Bass releases his grip and makes his N way marching toward the gazebo, pointing instructions. N Solomon is left, markers in hand, alone. O 166 166 T OMIT O 167 OMIT 167 O 118. S A168 EXT. ROAD BY EPPS\\' PLANTATION - EVENING A168 N Solomon sits on a secluded part of the road, fiddle in N hand. He stares across the expanse. His eyes fixed on N something that is a million miles away. N Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg N tighter and tighter. As the strings are taut, the sound N is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as N if bones are being cracked one by one. Just beyond the N breaking point of sound, there is a snap. N He then repeats the action. N Solomon holds the neck of the violin. Sliding his thumb N and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it N at the base. He carefully snaps the neck and removes it N from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the N ground. N He then starts on the body. Heaving it on the ground, it N falls apart. Methodically he breaks the violin into small N bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of N violence, rather than aggressive. Seems almost to be, in N an odd way, respectful. O 168 168 S EXT. MASTER EPPS\\'S PLANTATION/FIELD - DAY C -FEBRUARY, 1853- N The Slaves are sewing the heavily plowed field, making N their way in the trying soil. Solomon, too focused to N note the arrival of two men by carriage: Parker and the C SHERIFF. N While the Sheriff makes his way to the field, Parker N remains with the carriage. The Sheriff calls: C SHERIFF D Platt...? Where is the boy called C Platt? C SOLOMON D ...Sir... N The Sheriff crosses to him. C SHERIFF D Your name is Platt, is it? C SOLOMON D Yes, sir. N Pointing off to the distance. C SHERIFF D Do you know that man? O (CONTINUED) O 118A. O 168 CONTINUED: 168 N Solomon looks toward the carriage. He has to shield his N eyes from the sun. Recognition is slow coming to him. N But when it does, it hits him as a rush. C SOLOMON D Mr. Parker...? O (CONTINUED) O 119. O 168 CONTINUED: (2) 168 N Solomon starts for Parker, but he is pulled back by the N Sheriff who is keen to determine Solomon\\'s true identity. C SHERIFF D Say again? C SOLOMON D Mr. Parker? N As he does, Epps makes his way over. C SHERIFF D That man received a letter D compiling many accusations. You D look me in the eye and on your D life answer me truthfully: have D you any other name than Platt? C SOLOMON D Solomon Northup is my name. M EPPS D Sheriff... C SHERIFF D Have you a family? M EPPS D What\\'s all this? C SHERIFF D It\\'s official business. M EPPS D My nigger, my business. C SHERIFF D Your business waits. E (TO SOLOMON) D Tell me of your family. C SOLOMON D I have a wife and two children. C SHERIFF D What were your children\\'s names? C SOLOMON D Margaret and Alonzo. C SHERIFF D And your wife\\'s name before her D marriage? C SOLOMON D Anne Hampton. I am who I say. N Solomon pushes past the sheriff. As Solomon moves toward N Parker, his pace quickens with each step until his O (CONTINUED) O 119A. E 168 CONTINUED: (3) 168 D personal velocity has him nearly at a dead run. The two N old friends make contact with each other, wrap each other N in a long and emotional embrace. It if finally broken by N Epps, who has moved over with the Sheriff. O (CONTINUED) O 120. E 168 CONTINUED: (4) 168 M EPPS D Nah... You will unhand \\'em. D Platt is my nigger! C PARKER D He is Solomon Northup. M EPPS D You say... C PARKER D He belongs to no man. C EPPS D You say! You come here, D unfamiliar to me, and make claims. C SHERIFF D Not claims. I have no doubts. D This is Solomon Northup, a D resident of Saratoga Springs, NY. C EPPS D To hell with that! My nigger, and D I\\'ll fight you for \\'em! C PARKER D As is your right. As it will be D my pleasure to bankrupt you in the D courts. Your decision. D By this time, the slaves in the plantation have overcome N their fear of penalty, and left their work and gathered N in the yard as witnesses. They stand behind the cabin, N out of sight of Epps. N Mistress Epps also bears witness, standing on the veranda N next to her house slave. Her face is of a strange mixed N emotion. N Epps looks to Solomon. Solomon icily, stoically holds N his ground. He makes it quite clear in his countenance N that nobody owns him. Sheriff, hand on his gun, is there N to back Solomon up. Epps, with no other recourse than to N BACK DOWN: C EPPS D You think this is the last you\\'ll D see of me, boy? It ain\\'t. E (TO PARKER) C Whatever paper you hold about his D freedom, it don\\'t mean naught. He D is my nigger - and I will have my D day in court, sir. As God as my D witness, I will have my day in D court. Take \\'em! D Epps calls to Bob- O (CONTINUED) O 120A. E 168 CONTINUED: (5) 168 E EPPS (CONT\\'D) D Saddle my horse! And bring her up D here. S Epps walks back into the plantation. N The trio starts for the carriage. Solomon is pulled back N by the call of Patsey\\'s voice: C PATSEY D Platt... D Disregarding Parker, Solomon crosses over to Patsey. D Under the circumstances, neither really knows how to N engage. Finally, suddenly, Patsey throws her arms around N Solomon and they embrace. N Epps, now mounted on his horse, witness the encounter. N Kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse, he N rides off furiously. N Calling from the carriage, mindful of Epps: C PARKER D Solomon...if we know what\\'s wise, D we should depart. N A moment longer Solomon and Patsey hold each other. They N separate, Solomon heading back to the carriage. He and N Parker alight. The Sheriff chides the horses and they O (CONTINUED) O 121. S 168 CONTINUED: (6) 168 N start up. As they move on, Patsey sinks down to the N ground, where she remains in a weary and half-reclining N state, the other slaves around her. N WE STAY WITH Solomon as he travels further and further N from the slaves - who are diminished by distance. N Solomon waves a hand to them, but the carriage rounds a N bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes N forever more. T BLACK O A169 A169 S EXT. NORTHUP HOUSE - DAY N -MARCH, 1853- N We now see Solomon in front of a door. A door we have N seen before at the very beginning of our story. Solomon, N aged significantly since then, stands nervously, N swallowing, and adjusting his attire. He breaths in and N holds his breath. He blows out and closes his eyes. A N tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he N wants his family to see him. He gathers himself, and N looks to his right. There stands Mr. Parker. He places N his hand on Solomon\\'s shoulder. He says gently- C PARKER D Are you ready? N Solomon swallows and nods. O 169 169 S INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - LATER N THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPENS. Mr. Parker enters, Solomon N behind. We first see Anne, in her finest attire; the N Northup children: Alonzo, who is now seventeen and N Margaret who is now twenty - SHE CARRIES WITH HER A N BUNDLE. Also present is MARGARET\\'S HUSBAND. The family N waits patiently, dutifully...but anxiously. N Anne rises to greet him, but holds back. All around, the N body language of the family is stiff and awkward. They N are, after all - after twelve years - little more than N familiar strangers. C SOLOMON D I apologize for my appearance. I D have had a difficult time of D things these past many years. N Solomon looks among his family; trying to recall them as N much as they look to see familiarity within him. To his O CHILDREN: C SOLOMON (CONT\\'D) D Alonzo... Margaret, yes? You do D not recognize me, do you? Do E (MORE) (CONTINUED) O 122. O 169 CONTINUED: 169 C SOLOMON (CONT\\'D) D you...do you even remember the D last time we saw each other? I D put you on a carriage with your D mother... N Margaret, tearing, hugs her father. Solomon almost N breaks, but he keeps himself together. Looking to the N UNKNOWN MAN: C SOLOMON (CONT\\'D) D And who is this? C MARGARET D He is my husband. C SOLOMON D Husband? C MARGARET\\'S HUSBAND D It is very good to meet you, sir. C SOLOMON D We have much acquainting to do. N Margaret rises, she presents her bundle to her father. C MARGARET D And this is your grandson. C Solomon Northup Staunton. C SOLOMON D ...Solomon... D The fact his grandson carries his name, is overwhelming. N Solomon breaks down. Emotionally, physically... But N ANNE IS THERE TO CATCH HIM. As she holds him, Solomon N says to Anne with all his heart: C SOLOMON (CONT\\'D) D Forgive me. C ANNE D There is nothing to forgive. N The pair, joined now by the whole family, hold on to each N other for life...and one would think for all the rest of D their lives.
